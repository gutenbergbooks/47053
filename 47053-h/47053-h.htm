<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>For the name "Folk-lore" in its present signification,
embracing the Popular Traditions, Proverbial
Sayings, Superstitions, and Customs of the people, we
are in a great measure indebted to the late editor of
<cite>Notes and Queries</cite>&mdash;Mr. W. J. Thoms&mdash;who, in an
anonymous contribution to the <cite>Athenæum</cite> of 22nd
August, 1846, very aptly suggested this comprehensive
term, which has since been adopted as the recognised
title of what has now become an important branch of
antiquarian research.</p>

<p>The study of Folk-lore is year by year receiving
greater attention, its object being to collect,
classify, and preserve survivals of popular belief,
and to trace them as far as possible to their
original source. This task is no easy one, as school-boards
and railways are fast sweeping away every
vestige of the old beliefs and customs which, in days
gone by, held such a prominent place in social and
domestic life. The Folk-lorist has, also, to deal with
remote periods, and to examine the history of tales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
and traditions which have been handed down from
the distant past and have lost much of their meaning
in the lapse of years. But, as a writer in the
<cite>Standard</cite> has pointed out, Folk-lore students tread
on no man's toes. "They take up points of history
which the historian despises, and deal with monuments
more intangible but infinitely more ancient than those
about which Sir John Lubbock is so solicitous. They
prosper and are happy on the crumbs dropped from
the tables of the learned, and grow scientifically rich
on the refuse which less skilful craftsmen toss aside as
useless. The tales with which the nurse wiles her
charge asleep provide for the Folk-lore student a
succulent banquet&mdash;for he knows that there is scarcely
a child's story or a vain thought that may not be
traced back to the boyhood of the world, and to those
primitive races from which so many polished nations
have sprung."</p>

<p>The field of research, too, in which the Folk-lorist
is engaged is a most extensive one, supplying materials
for investigation of a widespread character. Thus
he recognises and, as far as he possibly can, explains
the smallest item of superstition wherever found, not
limiting his inquiries to any one subject. This, therefore,
whilst enhancing the value of Folk-lore as a study,
in the same degree increases its interest, since with a
perfect impartiality it lays bare superstition as it exists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
among all classes of society. Whilst condemning, it
may be, the uneducated peasant who places credence
in the village fortune-teller or "cunning man," we
are apt to forget how oftentimes persons belonging to
the higher classes are found consulting with equal
faith some clairvoyant or spirit-medium.</p>

<p>Hence, however reluctant the intelligent part of
the community may be to own the fact, it must be
admitted that superstition, in one form or another,
dwells beneath the surface of most human hearts,
although it may frequently display itself in the most
disguised or refined form. Among the lower orders,
as a writer has observed, "it wears its old fashions,
in the higher it changes with the rapidity of modes in
fashionable circles." Indeed, it is no matter of surprise
that superstition prevails among the poor and
ignorant, when we find the affluent and enlightened
in many cases quite as ready to repose their belief
in the most illogical ideas.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would only add that the present
little volume has been written with a view of showing
how this rule applies even to the daily routine of
Domestic Life, every department of which, as will be
seen in the following pages, has its own Folk-lore.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>BIRTH AND INFANCY.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Value of Superstitions&mdash;Lucky Days and Hours of Birth&mdash;The Caul&mdash;The
Changeling&mdash;The Evil Eye&mdash;"Up and not Down"&mdash;Rocking
the Empty Cradle&mdash;Teeth, Nails, and Hands&mdash;The
Maple and the Ash&mdash;Unchristened Children.</p></blockquote>


<p>Around every stage of human life a variety of customs
and superstitions have woven themselves, most of
which, apart from their antiquarian value, as having
been bequeathed to us from the far-off past, are interesting
in so far as they illustrate those old-world
notions and quaint beliefs which marked the social
and domestic life of our forefathers. Although, therefore,
many of these may appear to us meaningless, yet
it must be remembered that they were the natural
outcome of that scanty knowledge and those crude
conceptions which prevailed in less enlightened times
than our own. Probably, if our ancestors were in
our midst now, they would be able in a great measure
to explain and account for what is often looked upon
now-a-days as childish fancy and so much nursery
rubbish. In the present chapter it is proposed to
give a brief and general survey of the folk-lore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
associated with birth and infancy, without, however,
entering critically into its origin or growth, or tracing
its transmigration from one country to another.
Commencing, then, with birth, we find that many
influences are supposed to affect the future fortune
and character of the infant. Thus, in some places
great attention is paid to the day of the week on
which the child is born, as may be gathered from the
following rhyme still current in Cornwall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Sunday's child is full of grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monday's child is full in the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tuesday's child is solemn and sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wednesday's child is merry and glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thursday's child is inclined to thieving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friday's child is free in giving,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saturday's child works hard for his living"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>a piece of folk-lore varying, of course, in different
localities. By general consent, however, Sunday is
regarded as a most lucky day for birth, both in this
country and on the Continent; and according to the
"Universal Fortune-teller"&mdash;a book very popular
among the lower classes in former years&mdash;"great
riches, long life, and happiness" are in store for those
fortunate beings born on Sunday, while in Sussex
they are considered safe against drowning and hanging.
Importance is also attached to the hour of
birth; and the faculty of seeing much that is hidden
from others is said to be granted to children born at
the "chime hours," <i>i.e.</i>, the hours of three, six, nine,
or twelve&mdash;a superstition found in many parts of the
Continent. There is, too, an idea prevalent in Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that when a child is born in leap-year either it or its
mother will die within the course of the year&mdash;a
notion not unknown in our own country. Again,
from time immemorial various kinds of divination
have been in use for the purpose of discovering the
sex of an infant previous to its birth. One of these
is by means of a shoulder-of-mutton bone, which, after
the whole of the flesh has been stripped clean off,
must be hung up the last thing at night over the front
door of the house. On the following morning the sex
of the first person who enters, exclusive of the members
of the household, indicates the sex of the child.</p>

<p>We will next turn to some of the countless
superstitions connected with the new-born child. A
highly popular one refers to the caul&mdash;a thin membrane
occasionally found covering the head at birth,
and deemed specially lucky, as indicating, among other
things, that the child will never be drowned. It has
been, in consequence, termed the "holy" or "fortunate
hood," and great care is generally taken that it
should not be lost or thrown away, for fear of the
death or sickness of the child. This superstitious
fancy was very common in the primitive ages of the
Church, and St. Chrysostom inveighs against it in
several of his homilies. The presence of a caul on
board ship was believed to prevent shipwreck, and
owners of vessels paid a large price for them. Most
readers will, no doubt, recollect how Thomas Hood
wrote for his early work, "Whims and Oddities," a
capital ballad upon this vulgar error. Speaking of
the jolly mariner who confidently put to sea in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of the ink-black sky which "told every eye a storm
was soon to be," he goes on to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"But still that jolly mariner<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Took in no reef at all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in his pouch confidingly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He wore a baby's caul."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It little availed him, however; for as soon as the
storm in ruthless fury burst upon his frail bark, he</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Was smothered by the squall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven ne'er heard his cry, nor did<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ocean heed his <i>caul</i>!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Advocates also purchased them, that they might be
endued with eloquence, the price paid having often
been from twenty to thirty guineas. They seem to
have had other magical properties, as Grose informs us
that any one "possessed of a caul may know the state
of health of the person who was born with it. If
alive and well, it is firm and crisp; if dead or sick,
relaxed and flaccid." In France the luck supposed
to belong to a caul is proverbial, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être né coiffé</i>
is an expression signifying that a person is extremely
fortunate. Apart from the ordinary luck supposed to
attach to the "caul," it may preserve the child from a
terrible danger to which, according to the old idea, it is
ever exposed&mdash;namely, that of being secretly carried off
and exchanged by some envious witch or fairy for its
own ill-favoured offspring. This superstition was once
very common in many countries, and was even believed
by Martin Luther, if we are to rely on the following
extract from his "Table Book:"&mdash;"Changelings
Satan lays in the place of the genuine children, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
people may be tormented with them. He often
carries off young maidens into the water." This most
reprehensible of the practices attributed to the fairies
is constantly spoken of by our old writers, and is
several times mentioned by Shakespeare. In the
speech of Puck, in <cite>A Midsummer Night's Dream</cite>
(Act ii., sc. 1), that jovial sprite says of Titania's lovely
boy&mdash;the cause of quarrel between the King and
Queen of Elfland:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"She never had so sweet a changeling."</p>


<p>In the <cite>Winter's Tale</cite> (Act iv., sc. 4) the Shepherd,
on discovering the babe Perdita, tells the Clown,
"It was told me I should be rich by the fairies.
This is some changeling." As a preservation against
this danger, sundry charms are observed. Thus, in
the North of England, a carving-knife is still hung
from the head of the cradle, with the point suspended
near the child's face. In the Western Isles of Scotland
idiots are believed to be the fairies' changelings, and in
order to regain the lost child, parents have recourse to
the following device:&mdash;They place the changeling on
the beach, below high-water mark, when the tide is
out, and pay no heed to its screams, believing that the
fairies, rather than allow their offspring to be drowned
by the rising waters, will convey it away and restore
the child they had stolen. The sign that this has
been done is the cessation of the child's crying. In
Ireland, too, the peasants often place the child supposed
to be a changeling on a hot shovel, or torment
it in some other way. A similar practice is resorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to in Denmark, where the mother heats the oven, and
places the child on the peel, pretending to put it in;
and sometimes she whips it severely with a rod, or
throws it into the water. The only real safeguard,
however, against this piece of fairy mischief is baptism,
and hence the rite has generally been performed
among the peasantry as soon as possible after birth.</p>

<p>Another danger to which the new-born child is
said to be exposed, and to counteract which baptism
is an infallible charm, is the influence of the "evil
eye;" certain persons being thought to possess the
power of inflicting injury by merely looking on those
whom they wish to harm. Although this form of
superstition has been gradually dying out for many
years past, yet it still retains its hold in certain
country places. It is interesting to trace this notion
as far back as the time of the Romans; and in the
late Professor Conington's translation of the "Satires
of Persius" we find it thus laughably spoken of:&mdash;"Look
here! A grandmother or a superstitious aunt
has taken baby from his cradle, and is charming his
forehead against mischief by the joint action of her
middle finger and her purifying spittle; for she knows
right well how to check the evil eye." Confining ourselves,
however, to instances recorded in our own
country, we find that, even now-a-days, various charms
are practised for counteracting the baneful influence of
this cruel species of witchcraft. Thus, in Lancashire,
some of the chief consist in spitting three times in the
child's face, turning a live coal in the fire, exclaiming,
"The Lord be with us;" whilst in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of Burnley "drawing blood above the mouth" was
once a popular antidote. Self-bored or "lucky
stones" are often hung by the peasantry behind their
cottage doors; and in the South of England a copy of
the apocryphal letter of our Lord to Abgarus, King of
Edessa, may occasionally be seen pasted on the walls.
In many places, when a child pines or wastes away,
the cause is often attributed to the "evil eye," and one
remedy in use against this disaster is the following:&mdash;Before
sunrise it is brought to a blacksmith of the
seventh generation, and laid on the anvil. The smith
then raises his hammer as if he were about to strike
the hot iron, but brings it gently down on the child's
body. This is done three times, after which the child
is considered certain to amend. This superstition
survives in Cornwall; and the late Mr. Hawker, of
Morwenstow, a noted authority on such topics, tells us
that two-thirds of the inhabitants of the Tamar side
firmly believe in the power of the evil eye. In
Scotland this piece of folk-lore has prevailed extensively
from time immemorial, and one of the charms
to avert it is the "gold and silver water." A sovereign
and a shilling are put into water, which is sprinkled
over the patient in the name of the Trinity. Again,
in the Highlands of Scotland, ash-sap is given to new-born
children, because, in common with the rowan,
that tree is supposed to possess the property of resisting
the attacks of witches, fairies, and other imps of
darkness. The Irish think that not only their children
but their cattle are "eye-bitten" when they fall
suddenly sick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Among other important items of folk-lore associated
with birth may be mentioned the popular belief
that a child should go up in the world before it goes
down. On leaving its mother's room for the first
time, it is considered absolutely necessary that it
should be carried <em>up-stairs</em> before it goes <em>down-stairs</em>,
otherwise it will always keep low in the world, and
never rise in after-life either to riches or distinction.
When, however, as often happens, the mother's room
is on the top storey, the nurse overcomes the obstacle
by placing a chair near the door, on which she steps
before leaving the room. In Yorkshire it is further
stated that a new-born infant should always be placed
first in the arms of a maiden before any one else
touches it. It has been aptly questioned by Mr. Henderson,
in his "Folk-lore of the Northern Counties,"
whether we may not trace in this practice an outgrowth
of the mediæval belief that the Virgin Mary
was present at the birth of St. John the Baptist,
and received him first in her arms. Some, too, will
never permit an infant to sleep upon bones&mdash;that
is, the lap&mdash;a piece of folk-lore founded on some
degree of truth; for it has been pointed out that it is
undoubtedly better for a child to support it throughout
its whole length, than to allow its head or
legs to hang down, as they might probably do if the
infant was sleeping on the lap. Again, there is a
common idea that a baby and a kitten cannot thrive
in the same house; and should, therefore, as is not
unfrequently the case, a cat have kittens at the
time of a birth, these are immediately either destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
or given away. Few nurses, also, can be
found courageous enough to weigh a young child,
from a superstitious conviction that it is unfortunate
so to do, the child often dying, or, at any rate,
not thriving afterwards. Equally unlucky, too, is
it considered to rock baby's empty cradle, it being
an omen of its death&mdash;a belief which also prevails in
Scotland. The same notion exists in many parts of
the Continent, and the Swedish folk tell us that it
should be avoided, as it is apt to make the child noisy
and given to crying. It is also deprecated on another
ground, that it is ominous of another claimant for that
place of rest&mdash;a piece of folk-lore which the Sussex
peasantry express in the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If you rock the cradle empty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then you shall have babies plenty."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Many consider it a bad sign when the first tooth
makes its appearance in the upper jaw, denoting, it
is said, that the child will not survive its infancy.
Whilst speaking of teeth, it may be noted that they
occupy an important place in the folk-lore of infancy.
Many readers will no doubt recollect how the Duke
of Gloucester, in <cite>3 Henry VI.</cite> (Act v., sc. 6), when
describing the peculiarities connected with his birth,
relates that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The midwife wondered, and the women cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I was, which plainly signified<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In Sussex it is still customary for little children to
wear a necklace of beads made from the root of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
peony, as this is supposed to act as a charm in assisting
the cutting of their teeth. In the same county, too,
the peasantry have a great dislike to throwing away
the cast teeth of young children, believing that should
any be accidentally found and gnawed by an animal,
the child's new tooth would exactly correspond with
the animal's which had bitten the old one. Once
more, in Scotland and the North of England, when
the first teeth come out, sundry precautions are taken,
to make sure that the fresh ones may be sound and
healthy. One of these consists in filling the cavity
with salt, after which the tooth must be burnt, while
the following formula is repeated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Fire! fire! burn bone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God send me my tooth again."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This practice exists in Sweden, and likewise in Switzerland,
where the tooth is wrapped up in paper, with a
little salt, and then thrown into the fire. The teeth,
however, are not the only objects of superstition in
infancy, similar importance being attached to the nails.
In many places, for instance, it is considered imprudent
to cut them till baby is a year old, and then they
should be bitten off, or else there is a likelihood of its
growing up dishonest, or of its being, as the Sussex
peasantry say, "light-fingered." Anyhow, special
attention is to be paid to the day of the week on
which the child's nails are cut, if there be any
truth in a well-known proverb&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Better a child had ne'er been born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than cut his nails on a Sunday morn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The same warning is given in Germany, and if it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
disregarded, it is said that the child will be liable to
stammer as it grows up. A curious Northumberland
belief affirms that if the first parings of a child's nails
are carefully buried under an ash-tree, it will turn out
in after-life a capital singer. It is also a popular
fancy in nursery folk-lore that the child's future career
in this world can be easily augured from the little
specks on its nails, a species of palmistry still extensively
credited by even educated persons, and one, too,
not confined to infancy. Again, the infant's tiny
hands are not free from superstition, and here and
there, throughout the country, there is a notion that
for the first few months after its birth the right one
should remain unwashed, the reason assigned for this
strange piece of eccentricity being that it may gather
riches. According to another idea, children born
open-handed are said to be of a bountiful disposition.
In Scotland, too, great attention is paid as to which
hand a child uses when taking up for the first time
a spoon to eat. If it should happen to be the left,
then, alas! he is doomed to be an unlucky fellow
all through his life. Indeed, as far as we can judge
from the numerous items of folk-lore still in vogue, it
would seem that the early period of infancy, in one
way or another, furnishes countless opportunities for
ascertaining what kind of life is in store for the child
in years to come, almost every trivial action being
regarded as indicative of something or other that shall
befall it. Although many of these ideas may seem to
us in this nineteenth century apparently senseless, yet
it must be remembered they are frequently survivals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of primitive culture, and are interesting as having
been handed down to us from the distant past.
According to an old superstition, parents desirous of
securing long life for their children should pass them
through the branches of a maple. A few years ago
one of these trees had long been resorted to for this
purpose in West Grinstead Park, and as soon as a
rumour spread through the parish that it was about to
be demolished, quite a consternation prevailed in the
neighbourhood. Similar properties are supposed to
belong to the ash, weakly infants that do not thrive
being drawn through a cleft in its trunk. This charm,
as performed in Cornwall, is thus:&mdash;A large knife is
inserted into the trunk of a young ash, about a foot
from the ground, and a vertical opening made for
about three feet. Two men then forcibly pull the
parts asunder, and hold them so, whilst the mother
passes the child through the cleft three times. The
ceremony does not end here, as the child has to be
washed for three successive mornings in the dew from
the leaves of the "charmed ash." This supposed
magical property of the ash has an additional interest,
when we consider that some thousands of years ago
our ancestors regarded it as one of their wonder-working
trees, and associated it with some of their
oldest traditions. At the present day, too, it is the
subject of an extensive folk-lore, to which we shall
have occasion to refer <a href="#Page_166">in a succeeding chapter</a>.</p>

<p>Again, if a baby frets and does not appear to
thrive, it is supposed by some to be "longing." Thus,
a Sussex nurse one day said to a lady, "Baby is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
uncommon fretty, I do believe he must be longing for
something." When asked what he could be longing
for, she replied, "Something that his mother longed
for, but did not get, before he was born, and the best
way to satisfy him would be, I think, to try him with
a brandied cherry, or some hare's brains." This piece
of superstition, however, is not confined to Sussex.
Once more, in addition to the popular notion that cats
suck the breath of infants and so cause their death&mdash;one,
indeed, without a particle of truth&mdash;there is
another in which poor pussy is the victim, an illustration
of which we quote from "Rambles in an Old
City," by a Norfolk author:&mdash;"Not long since a
woman, holding quite a respectable rank among the
working classes, avowed herself determined to 'drownd'
the cat as soon as ever her baby, which was lying ill,
should die. The only explanation she could give for
this determination was that the cat jumped upon the
nurse's lap as the baby lay there soon after it was
born, from which time it ailed, and ever since that
time the cat had regularly gone under its bed once a
day and coughed twice. These mysterious actions of
poor 'Tabby' were assigned as the cause of the baby
wasting, and its fate was to be sealed as soon as that
of the poor infant was decided. That the baby
happened to be the twenty-fourth child of his mother,
who had succeeded in rearing only four of the two
dozen, was a fact that seemed to possess no weight
whatever in her estimation." This strange antipathy
to our domestic animal no doubt took its origin in the
old belief that the cat's is one of the numerous forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which witches are fond of assuming, and on this
account, in days gone by, poor pussy was oftentimes
subjected to gross ill-treatment at the hands of the
ignorant classes. At the present day, in Germany,
there is a deep-rooted belief that witches, when bent
on doing mischief, take the form of a cat, and many
stories are current of their frightening their victims
by appearing as "the nightmare;" or, if dishonestly
disposed, of their drinking their neighbour's beer.
Returning, however, again to the subject of our
present chapter, there is a superstitious fancy in the
North of England that it is unlucky to walk over the
graves of unchristened children, which is vulgarly
called "unchristened ground," the person who does so
rendering himself liable to catching the fatal disease
of the "grave-scab." This complaint, we are told by
Mr. Henderson, "comes on with a trembling of the
limbs and hard breathing, and at last the skin burns
as if touched with hot iron," in allusion to which
an old ballad tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"And it ne'er will be cured by doctor on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tho' every one should tent him, oh!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall tremble and die like the elf-shot eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And return from whence he came, oh!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is, however, a remedy, though not easy of
attainment&mdash;"It lies in the wearing a sark, thus
prepared:&mdash;The lint must be grown in a field which
shall be manured from a farmyard heap that has not
been disturbed for forty years. It must be spun by
Habbitrot, the queen of spinsters; it must be bleached
by an honest bleacher, in an honest miller's mill-dam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and sewed by an honest tailor. On donning this
mysterious vestment, the sufferer will at once regain
his health and strength." Unfortunately the necessary
conditions for the successful accomplishment of this
charm are so difficult, that he must be a clever man
who can fulfil them. In the South of England, on
the other hand, we do not find the same dread
attaching to the graves of still-born children. Thus
on a certain occasion, when one of the Commissioners
of Devonport complained that a charge of one shilling
and sixpence should have been made upon the parish
authorities for the grave and interment of a still-born
child, he added that "when he was a young man it
was thought lucky to have a still-born child put into
an open grave, as it was considered to be a sure passport
to heaven for the next person buried there."
According to another superstitious notion, if a mother
frets and pines after her baby when it is dead, it is
said that it cannot rest, and will come back to earth
again. Various stories are on record of children thus
visiting their mothers after death, an instance of
which we quote from the "Dialect of Leeds:"&mdash;It
appears that soon after the birth of the mother's
next child, the previous one that had died entered
her room with eyes deeply sunken, as if with much
weeping, and on approaching the bed, said, "Mother,
I can't rest if you will go on fretting." She replied,
"Well, lad, I wean't fret any more." He then
looked upon the bed and said, "Let's luke at it,
mother!" She turned down the coverlet and let
him look at her new-born babe. "It'll die," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and vanished. These, then, are some of the boundless
dangers and difficulties that are supposed to beset the
beginnings of life; and, taking into consideration the
importance of that momentous crisis, when a fresh
actor is introduced upon the world's great stage, it is
not surprising that this event has, in most ages and
countries, been associated with divers superstitions,
and given rise to sundry customs, each of which
has helped to invest man's entry into this world with
all that grandeur which such a solemn occasion
requires.</p>

<p class="hang">Nursery Literature&mdash;The Power of Baptism&mdash;Confirmation&mdash;Popular
Prayers&mdash;Weather Rhymes&mdash;School Superstitions&mdash;Barring
out.</p></blockquote>


<p>It must not be supposed that childhood has no special
folk-lore of its own. It is, in fact, of a most varied
kind, many of the old traditionary beliefs and practices
associated with the nursery being relics of what the
Scandinavian mothers taught their children in days of
long ago. The familiar fairy-tales of our own childhood
still form the nursery literature in most homes,
and are of unusual interest as embodying not only the
myths and legends of the ancient Aryan race, but
their conceptions about the world around them. Thus,
for instance, the well-known story of "Cinderella,"
like many others of the same character, such as "Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the Giant Killer," or "Beauty and the Beast," are to
be found in almost all countries, and although the
versions differ in some respects, yet they point to
a common origin at a very remote period. Indeed,
it is curious that there should still exist among the
children of the nineteenth century an undying love for
these survivals of Aryan literature, couched in such
graceful and simple language that few modern compositions
can be found to equal them. In reading,
therefore, about the dwellers in Wonderland, the
young mind is unconsciously taking in primitive
notions about the workings of nature as seen in the
succession of day and night, the changes of the
seasons, and so on. In the story of "Cinderella," we
have the ancient nature-myth of the sun and the
dawn, representing the morning sun in the form of a
fairy prince pursuing Cinderella, the dawn, to claim
her for his bride, whilst the envious clouds, her
sisters, and the moon, her stepmother, strive to keep
her in the background. It would, however, take too
long and require a book of itself to discuss the history
and meaning of these fairy tales which so delight the
childish fancy, and exercise such a wholesome influence,
inculcating some of the noblest sentiments
and loftiest teachings of the founders of our race.
Referring then more particularly to the superstitions
connected with childhood, we would, first of all,
briefly speak of those relating to certain outward
circumstances, which are believed to affect more or
less the child's welfare in life.</p>

<p>Thus, it is a deep-rooted belief that a child never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
thrives until after its baptism; and in cases of illness
the clergyman is more often perhaps sent for
by the poor from a belief in the physical virtue of
the sacred rite itself, rather than from any actual conviction
of its religious importance. Indeed, how
much potency is supposed to reside in baptism may
be gathered from the countless superstitions with
which it is associated, the omission of this rite being
attended more often than not with fatal results.
Hence it is frequently performed as soon as possible
after birth, one reason being, as we have already
seen, that so long as the child remains unbaptised it
is thought to be at the mercy of ill-disposed fairies,
and subject to the influence of the evil eye. According
to another popular fancy, not confined to our
own country, should a child have the misfortune to
die unchristened, it is doomed either to flit restlessly
around its parents' abode, or to wander about in
deserted spots, daily repining over its hard and
unenviable lot. In Germany, tradition says that
such children are transformed into that delusive little
meteor known as the will-o'-the-wisp, and so ceaselessly
hover between heaven and earth. On one occasion,
we are told of a Dutch parson who, happening to go
home to his village late one evening, fell in with no
less than three of these fiery phenomena. Remembering
them to be the souls of unbaptised children, he
solemnly stretched out his hand and pronounced the
words of baptism over them. Much, however, to his
terrible consternation and surprise, in the twinkling
of an eye a thousand or more of these apparitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
suddenly made their appearance&mdash;no doubt all equally
anxious to be christened. The good man, runs the
story, was so terribly frightened, that forgetting all
his good intentions, he took to his heels and ran home
as fast as his legs could take him. In Lusatia, where
the same superstition prevails, the souls of these
unhappy children, which hover about in the form of
will-o'-the-wisps, are said to be relieved from their
unhappy wanderings so soon as any pious hand throws
a handful of consecrated ground after them.</p>

<p>In Scotland, to make quite sure of baptism being
altogether propitious, it was deemed highly important
that the person entrusted with the care of the child
should be known by common report to be lucky. She
was generally provided with a piece of bread and
cheese, which she presented to the first person she met
as an offering from the infant. If the party readily
accepted and partook of the proffered gift, it was undoubtedly
a good omen; but if refused it was considered
tantamount to wishing evil to the child. Hence
the future destiny of the little one was often augured
from this superstitious ceremony, which, by-the-by,
is also practised in the West of England, but the
events of its after-life only too often belied the weal
and woe predicted for it. Again, it is thought highly
necessary that the child should cry at its baptism, or else
ill-luck will sooner or later overtake it, the idea being
that, when the child screams and kicks, the evil spirit
is in the act of quitting it; its silence, on the other
hand, indicating that it is too good for this wicked
world. An amusing little episode in illustration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
this curious superstition is related by Mrs. Latham,
in the "Folk-lore Record:"&mdash;"I was lately present
at a christening in Sussex, when a lady of the party,
who was grandmother of the child, whispered in a
voice of anxiety, 'The child never cried; why did
not the nurse rouse it up?' After we had left the
church she said to her, 'O nurse, why did not you
pinch baby?' And when the baby's good behaviour
was afterwards commented upon, she observed, with a
very serious air, 'I wish that he had cried.'" In the
same county it is considered unlucky to divulge a
child's intended name before its baptism; and the
water sprinkled on its forehead at the font must on
no account be wiped off. Whilst on the subject of
baptism, we would just note that in former years
peculiar curative properties were supposed to reside
in water that had been used at this rite, and on this
account it was employed for various disorders. It
was also regarded in Scotland as a preservative
against witchcraft; and eyes bathed in it were rendered
for life incapable of seeing ghosts.</p>

<p>It may not be inappropriate to allude here to the
superstitions relative to confirmation, following in due
time, as this rite does, on baptism. In Norfolk, for
instance, it is considered unlucky to be touched by the
bishop's left hand; and in Devonshire, also, where a
similar notion prevails, young people look upon his
right hand as the lucky one, and should it not be their
privilege to receive it, they leave the church much
disappointed. In some of the northern counties, we
are informed that the unfortunate recipients of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
left hand are doomed, then and there, to a life of single
blessedness. This is not the only species of superstition
belonging to confirmation, for instances are on
record of persons who, although confirmed in their early
life, have again presented themselves for confirmation
in their old age, under a conviction that the bishop's
blessing would cure them of some bodily ailment.
It is related that, at one of the confirmations of
the venerable Bishop Bathurst, an old woman was
observed eagerly pressing forward to the church. A
by-stander, somewhat amazed at her odd conduct,
and struck with her aged appearance, inquired if she
was going to be confirmed, and, being answered in
the affirmative, expressed his astonishment that she
should have procrastinated it to such an advanced
time of life. The old woman, however, resented his
reproof, replying "that it was not so; that she had
already been bishopped seven times, and intended to
be again, it was so good for her rheumatism!"</p>

<p>In some cases the prayers taught by the poor to
their children are curious. Thus, a popular prayer,
formerly in use, and not yet forgotten, is evidently
a relic of Roman Catholic times, having been handed
down from a period anterior to the Reformation.
As the reader will see, the version below contains a
distinct appeal to certain saints for their intercession
with God on the child's behalf:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless the bed I lie upon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four corners to my bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four angels at its head,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<span class="i0">One to watch, two to pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one to bear my soul away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God within and God without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Jesus Christ all round about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I die before I wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pray to God my soul to take."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It has been pointed out that it is very singular that
this prayer should have survived the great change
which took place in religious opinion in the sixteenth
century, and that it even still remains in use.
There are many variations of it, and the following
two distiches obtained from Lancashire are quaint,
having been written, it has been thought, by the
Puritans, in ridicule:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold the horse that I leap on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take a stick and lay upon."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A Lincolnshire clergyman, anxious to learn something
of the nature of the prayers said by the children
of the agricultural poor, visited some of their cottages a
few years ago in the evening, and listened to the little
ones as they said their prayers. The concluding portion,
he tells us, was always intercession for relations,
but the form it generally took was peculiar. In the
first place, it was not, as is the case with the more
educated classes, "Pray God bless father and mother,"
&amp;c., but "Pray for father, pray for mother, pray for
brothers and sisters," and so on. In certain cases,
through carelessness and rapidity, the words had
degenerated into "Pray father, pray mother," &amp;c.
There can be no doubt that originally the prayer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
this:&mdash;"Pray for father;" then a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater noster</i>, or an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave Maria</i>, or both, would be said; then "Pray for
mother," &amp;c. After the Reformation, as time went
on, the constant repetition of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater</i> and the use
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave Maria</i> would gradually die out with the
change of religious ideas, and thus the prayer would
assume its present form, "Pray for father, pray for
mother."</p>

<p>Referring, in the second place, to the superstitions
of children, we find an immense number of curious
rhymes on various subjects used by them throughout
the country. While many of these have, no doubt,
been taught them by nurserymaids, a great part, as
Mr. Chambers has pointed out in his "Popular Rhymes
of Scotland," may be thought to have taken their
rise in the childish imagination during that familiar
acquaintance with natural objects, which it is one of
the most precious privileges of the young to enjoy in
rural districts. Besides, too, we must not forget that
children seem to have a peculiar love for all natural
objects, often finding pleasure in looking at some wayside
flower, or in watching the movements of some
tiny insect, which in after-years do not bring them
the same interest. The fact, indeed, that the young
mind is a true admirer of nature in all probability
accounts for many of those pleasing rhymes which
constitute much of the child's folk-lore.</p>

<p>Some of the charms, for instance, used to influence
the weather are curious, and it is worthy of note
that these, in many cases, are not confined to childhood
only, but are frequently found in the mouths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
our peasants. Thus the child's appeal to rain for its
departure has become a general charm, and is familiar
to most readers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Rain, rain, go to Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair weather, come again."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Aubrey considers this rhyme of great antiquity, and
says that "it is derived from the Gentiles." Often in
summer-time, when a thunder-shower interrupts some
out-door game, one may hear a chorus of young voices

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Rain, rain, go away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come another summer's day."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or, as other versions have it, "Come again on washing-day."
The appearance of a rainbow is generally, too,
the signal for various marks of dissatisfaction on the
part of the young, who, besides entreating it to vanish
as soon as possible, frequently try to charm it away.
This they do by placing a couple of straws or twigs
crossways on the ground, and so, to quote their phrase,
"cross out the rainbow." Another way is to make a
cross of two sticks, and to lay four pebbles on it, one
at each end. Again, some of the rhymes relating to
snow are highly quaint, the following being repeated
when it makes its first appearance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The men of the East<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are picking their geese,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sending their feathers here away, here away."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When, however, boys wish the snow to go away, they
sing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Snow, snow, give over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cow's in the clover."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>Thunder, in the North of England, is called by children
"Rattley-bags," and during a storm the boys are
in the habit of singing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Rowley, Rowley, Rattley-bags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the lasses and leave the lads."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is a rhyme which is often repeated by the
juvenile folks in the north and midland counties upon
seeing the new moon, which, perhaps, may have an
indirect allusion to its supposed lucky influence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"I see the moon and the moon sees me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God help the parson that baptised me!"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>containing, evidently, a congratulation upon their birth.
Boys, too, have a curious saying respecting the reflection
of the sun's beams upon a ceiling, which
they term "Jack-a-dandy beating his wife with a stick
of silver." If a mischievous boy, with a piece of
looking-glass, throws the reflection into the eyes of a
neighbour, the latter complains "he's throwing Jack-a-dandy
in my eyes."</p>

<p>Passing on to other charm-rhymes connected with
natural objects, there are a very numerous class
relating to the animal creation. In evening-time,
for instance, when the dew begins to fall, boys are
fond of hunting the large black snails, on discovering
which they exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Snail, snail, put out your horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I'll kill your father and mother i' th' morn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This charm, however, is not confined to our own
country, but under a variety of forms is found on the
Continent. In Scotland, too, children prognosticate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the coming weather from the movements of this little
creature:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Snailie, snailie, shoot out your horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell us if it will be a bonny day the morn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>School-life, again, has its customs and superstitions,
many of which have been transmitted from
generation to generation; and childhood, indeed,
would seem quite incomplete without them. Thus,
according to an odd notion universally accepted in
days gone by, and still received with implicit faith,
if the master's cane is carefully nicked at the upper
end, and a hair inserted, it will, as soon as used, split
immediately to the very tip. In school-games, the
usual antipathy to odd numbers is found, and a child
is easily persuaded to give away a marble to make the
number even. A kind of divination, also, is still
frequently employed by boys to settle matters of
difficulty, such, for example, as who shall be the
leaders in a game, the choice of partners, and other
details which are deemed of equal importance. The
mode of procedure is this:&mdash;A long stick is thrown
into the air, and caught by one of the parties. Each
one then grasps it hand over hand, and he who
succeeds in getting the last hold is the successful
party. Mr. Henderson says that an odd expression
was formerly connected with the lending a knife
among boys for the cutting up of a cake or other
dainty, the borrowers being asked to give it back
"laughing," <i>i.e.</i>, with some of the good things it was
used to cut.</p>

<p>Among the many old school customs, we may close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
our present chapter by mentioning a popular one
known as "barring out," upon which, it may be
remembered, Miss Edgeworth has founded one of her
instructive stories. The practice consisted in "barring
out" the masters from the scene of their educational
labours, the agents in this ceremony being the
pupils of the school. It was an occasion of no small
disorder&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Not school-boys at a barring out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised ever such incessant rout."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Addison is reported to have been the leader of a
barring out at the Lichfield Grammar School, and to
have displayed on the occasion a spirit of disorderly
daring very different to that timid modesty which
so characterised his after-life. So much, then, for
the folk-lore of childhood, a subject indeed full
of interest, and possessing a worth far beyond the
circle of its own immediate influence, inasmuch as
even the simplest nursery jingle or puerile saying
has often been found of help in proving the affinity
of certain races, and has an ethnological value which
the student of comparative philology would be slow to
underrate in his task of research.</p>

<small>LOVE AND COURTSHIP.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Love-tests&mdash;Plants used in Love-charms&mdash;The Lady-bird&mdash;The
Snail&mdash;St. Valentine's Day&mdash;Midsummer Eve&mdash;Hallowe'en&mdash;Omens
on Friday.</p></blockquote>


<p>No event in human life has, from the earliest times,
been associated with a more extensive folk-lore than
marriage, which is indeed no matter of surprise,
considering that this is naturally looked upon as the
happiest epoch&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>&mdash;of each one's
career in this world. Hence, to write a detailed
account of the charms, omens, and divinations, as
well as of the superstitions and customs, connected
with marriage, including its early stages of love and
courtship, would require a volume for itself, so
varied and widespread is this subject of universal
interest.</p>

<p>In the present chapter, however, have been collected
together, in as condensed a form as possible, some of
the principal items of folk-lore connected with love and
courtship, as we find them scattered here and there
throughout the country. Commencing, then, with
love-divinations, these are of every conceivable kind,
the anxious maiden apparently having left no stone
unturned in her anxiety to ascertain her lot in the
marriage state. Hence in her natural longings to
raise the veil of futurity, the aspirant to matrimony,
if she be at all of a superstitious turn of mind, seldom
lets an opportunity pass by without endeavouring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gain from it some sign or token of the kind of
husband that is in store for her. As soon, too, as the
appointed one has at last presented himself, she is not
content to receive with unreserved faith his professions
of love and life-long fidelity; but, in her sly
moments, when he is not at hand, she proves the
genuineness of his devotion by certain charms which,
while they cruelly belie his character, only too often
unkindly deceive the love-sick maiden.</p>

<p>In the first place, we may note that love-tests have
been derived from a variety of sources, such as plants,
insects, animals, birds, not to mention those countless
other omens obtained from familiar objects to which
we shall have occasion to allude. At the outset,
however, it may not be uninteresting to quote the
following account of love-charms in use about one
hundred and fifty years ago, and which was written
by a young lady to the editor of the <cite>Connoisseur</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arabella was in love with a clever Londoner,
and had tried all the approved remedies. She had
seen him several times in coffee grounds with a sword
by his side; he was once at the bottom of a tea-cup
in a coach and six, with his two footmen behind it.
On the last May morning she went into the fields to
hear the cuckoo; and when she pulled off her left
shoe, she found a hair in it the exact colouring of his.
The same night she sowed hempseed in the back yard,
repeating the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Hempseed I sow, hempseed I hoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he that is my true love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come after me and mow.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>After that she took a clean shift and turned it, and hung
it on the back of a chair; and very likely he would have
come and turned it, for she heard a step, and being
frightened could not help speaking, and that broke
the spell. The maid Betty recommended her young
mistress to go backwards, without speaking a word,
into the garden on Midsummer Eve, and gather a
rose, keep it in a clean sheet of paper without looking
in it till Christmas Day, it will be as fresh as in June;
and if she sticks this rose in her bosom, he that is to
be her husband will come and take it out. Arabella
had tried several other strange fancies. Whenever
she lies in a strange bed, she always ties her garters
nine times round the bed-post, and knits nine knots in
it, saying all the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'This knot I knit, this knot I tie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see my love as he goes by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his apparel and array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he walks in every day.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the last occasion Mr. Blossom drew the curtains
and tucked up the clothes at the bed's feet. She has
many times pared an apple whole, and afterwards
flung the peel over her head, and on each occasion the
peel formed the first letter of his Christian name or
surname."</p>

<p>Referring to the use of plants in love-charms, they
are very numerous. One popular one consists in
taking the leaves of yarrow, commonly called "nosebleed,"
and tickling the inside of the nostrils, repeating
at the same time these lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Green 'arrow, green 'arrow, you bear a white blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my love love me, my nose will bleed now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my love don't love me, it 'ont bleed a drop;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my love do love me, 'twill bleed every drop."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some cut the common brake or fern just above the
root to ascertain the initial letters of the future wife's
or husband's name; and the dandelion, as a plant
of omen, is much in demand. As soon as its seeds
are ripe they stand above the head of the plant in
a globular form, with a feathery top at the end of
each seed, and then are without any difficulty detached.
When in this condition the flower-stalk
must be carefully plucked, so as not to injure the
globe of seeds, the charm consisting in blowing off the
seeds with the breath. The number of puffs that are
required to blow every seed clean off indicates the
number of years that must elapse before the person
is married. Again, nuts and apples are very favourite
love-tests. The mode of procedure is for a girl to
place on the bars of the grate a nut, repeating this
incantation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If he loves me, pop and fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he hates me, live and die."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As may be imagined, great is the dismay if the
anxious face of the inquirer gradually perceives the
nut, instead of making the hoped-for pop, die and
make no sign. Again, passing on to insects, one
means of divination is to throw a lady-bird into the
air, repeating meanwhile the subjoined couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Fly away east, and fly away west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show me where lives the one I like best."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>Should this little insect chance to fly in the direction
of the house where the loved one resides, it is regarded
as a highly-favourable omen. The snail, again, was
much used in love-divinations, many an eager maiden
anxious of ascertaining her lover's name following the
example of Hobnelia, who, in order to test the constancy
of her Lubberkin, did as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Upon a gooseberry bush a snail I found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For always snails near sweetest fruit abound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seized the vermin, home I quickly sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the hearth the milk-white embers spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow crawled the snail, and, if I right can spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the soft ashes marked a curious L.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! may this wondrous omen lucky prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'L' is found in Lubberkin and Love."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Three magpies are said to prognosticate a wedding;
and in our rural districts the unmarried of either sex
calculate the number of years of single blessedness
still allotted to them by counting the cuckoo's notes
when they first hear it in the spring.</p>

<p>Some days are considered specially propitious for
practising love-divinations. Foremost among these is
St. Valentine's Day, a festival which has been considered
highly appropriate for such ceremonies, as
there is an old tradition that on this day birds
choose their mates, a notion which is frequently
alluded to by the poets, and particularly by Chaucer,
to which reference is made also in <cite>A Midsummer
Night's Dream</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Good morrow, friends, St. Valentine is past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begin the wood-birds but to couple now."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus, the Devonshire young ladies have a fancy that
on St. Valentine's Day they can, if they wish, make
certain of their future. If so disposed, they go into
the churchyard at midnight, with some hempseed in
their hand, which, after they have walked round the
church a certain number of times, they scatter on
either side as they return homewards, repeating a
certain charm. It is supposed that the true lover will
be seen taking up the hempseed just sown, attired for
the ceremony in a winding-sheet. Another species of
love-divination once observed consisted in obtaining
five bay leaves, four of which the anxious maiden
pinned at the four corners of her pillow, and the fifth
in the middle. If she was fortunate enough to dream
of her lover, it was a sure sign that he would be
married to her in the course of the year. Again,
some young people would boil an egg hard, and, after
taking out the contents, fill the shell with salt, the
charm consisting in eating the shell and salt on
going to bed at night without either speaking or drinking
after it. A further method of divination was
practised in the following way:&mdash;The lady wrote her
lovers' names upon small pieces of paper, and, rolling
them up in clay, put them into a tub of water. The
first that rose to the surface was to be not only her
Valentine, but, in all probability, her future husband.</p>

<p>Another time, which has been equally popular from
time immemorial for such superstitious practices, is
Midsummer Eve. People gathered on this night the
rose, St. John's wort, trefoil, and rue, each of which
was supposed to have magical properties. They set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
orpine in clay upon pieces of slate in their houses,
under the name of a Midsummer man. As the stalk
next morning was found to incline to the right or left,
the anxious maiden knew whether her lover would
prove true to her or not.</p>

<p>Hallowe'en, again, has been supposed to be the
time, of all other times, when supernatural influences
prevail, and on this account is regarded as a night of
sure divination in love matters. All kinds of devices
have, therefore, been resorted to at this season, and
in the North of England many superstitions still
linger on, where this festival is known as "nutcrack-night,"
from nuts forming a prominent feature
in the evening feast. Once more, Christmas Eve
is well known to love-sick swains and languishing
maidens as an excellent day for obtaining a glimpse
into futurity. Numerous are the spells and ceremonies
by which this is attempted. Thus in some
places, at "the witching hour of night," the young
damsel goes into the garden and plucks twelve sage
leaves, under the belief that she will see the shadowy
form of her future husband approach her from the
opposite end of the ground. In trying this delicate
mode of divination great care must be taken not to
break or damage the sage-stalk, as should this happen
serious consequences might ensue. The following barbarous
charm was also much practised in days gone
by:&mdash;The heart was taken from a living pigeon, stuck
full of pins, and laid on the hearth, and while it was
burning, the form of the young person's future partner
was believed to become visible to mortal eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Friday has been held a good day of the week for
love omens, and in Norfolk the following lines are
repeated on three Friday nights successively, as on
the last one it is believed that the young lady will
dream of her future husband:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"To-night, to-night, is Friday night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay me down in dirty white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dream who my husband is to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay my children by my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I'm to live to be his bride."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There are numerous other modes of matrimonial
divination which still find favour in the eyes of those
who prefer the married state to that of virginity.
Thus the seeds of butter-dock must be scattered on
the ground by a young unmarried girl half an hour
before sunrise on a Friday morning in a lonesome
place. She must strew the seeds gradually on the
grass, saying these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"I sow, I sow!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, my own dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come here, come here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mow, and mow."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>After this she will see her future husband mowing
with a scythe at a short distance from her. She
must, however, display no symptoms of fear, for
should she cry out in alarm he will immediately
vanish. This method is said to be infallible, but it
is regarded as a bold, desperate, and presumptuous
undertaking. Some girls, again, make a hole in the
road where four ways meet, and apply their ear to it,
with the hope of learning of what trade their future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
husband is to be. It is unnecessary, however, to
illustrate this part of our subject further, for the
preceding pages amply show how varied and extensive
are the omens and divinations connected with an
event without which life is considered in the eyes of
most persons incomplete. Although these may seem
trivial and often nonsensical, yet they have often
exercised an important influence over that period of
anxious suspense which intervenes between courtship
and marriage, often tantalising and damping in a cruel
manner the hopes of many an ardent lover.</p>

<small>MARRIAGE.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Seasons and Days propitious to Marriage&mdash;Superstitions connected
with the Bride&mdash;Meeting a Funeral&mdash;Robbing the Bride of
Pins&mdash;Dancing in a Hog's Trough&mdash;The Wedding-cake&mdash;The
Ring.</p></blockquote>


<p>In selecting the time for the marriage ceremony precautions
of every kind have generally been taken to
avoid an unlucky month and day for the knot to be
tied. Indeed, the old Roman notion that May marriages
are unlucky survives to this day in England,
a striking example, as Mr. Tylor has pointed out in
his "Primitive Culture," of how an idea, the meaning
of which has perished for ages, may continue
to exist simply because it has existed. That May
with us is not a month for marrying may easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
be seen any year from the list of weddings in the
<cite>Times</cite> newspaper, the popular belief being summed up
in the familiar proverb, "Marry in May and you'll
rue the day." Some of the numerous reasons assigned
for the ill-luck attaching to this month are the following:&mdash;That
women disobeying the rule would be
childless; or if they had children, that the first-born
would be an idiot, or have some physical deformity;
or that the married couple would not live happily
together in their new life, but soon become weary of
each other's society&mdash;superstitions which still retain
their hold throughout the country. In spite, however,
of this absurd prejudice, it seems that in days gone by
May was honoured in feudal England as the month
of all months especially congenial to lovers. Most
readers are no doubt acquainted with the following
stanza in the "Court of Love:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"I had not spoke so sone the words, but she,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My soveraine, did thank me heartily,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saide, 'Abide, ye shall dwell still with me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till season come of May, for then truly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The King of Love and all his company<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall holde his feste full rially and well,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there I bode till that the season fell."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the other hand, June is a highly popular month
for marrying, one reason perhaps being that the earth
is then clothed in her summer beauty, and that this is
a season of plenty. At any rate, this notion may be
traced up to the time of the Romans, and thus when
Ovid was anxious about the marriage of his daughter,
he&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Resolved to match the girl, and tried to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What days unprosp'rous were, what moons were kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After June's sacred Ides his fancy strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good to the man and happy to the maid."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among the other seasons admitting or prohibiting
matrimony may be mentioned the following, contained
in a well-known rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Advent marriages doth deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hilary gives thee liberty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Septuagesima says thee nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eight days from Easter says you may;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rogation bids thee to contain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Trinity sets thee free again."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Equal importance has been attached by some to
the day of the week on which the marriage is performed.
Thus Friday, on account of its being regarded
as an inauspicious and evil day for the commencement
of any kind of enterprise, is generally
avoided, few brides being found bold enough to run
the risk of incurring bad luck from being married on a
day of ill-omen. In days gone by, Sunday appears to
have been a popular day for marriages; although, as
Mr. Jeaffreson, in his amusing history of "Brides
and Bridals," remarks, "A fashionable wedding, celebrated
on the Lord's Day in London, or any part
of England, would now-a-days be denounced by
religious people of all Christian parties as an outrageous
exhibition of impiety. But in our feudal
times, and long after the Reformation, Sunday was, of
all days of the week, the favourite one for marriages.
Long after the theatres had been closed on Sundays,
the day of rest was the chief day for weddings with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Londoners of every social class." The brides of
Elizabethan dramas are usually represented as being
married on Sunday. Thus in the <cite>Taming of the
Shrew</cite>, Petruchio, after telling his future father-in-law
"that upon Sunday is the wedding-day," and
laughing at Katharine's petulant exclamation, "I'll
see thee hanged on Sunday first," says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will have rings, and things, and give array;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, kiss me, Kate, we will be married o' Sunday."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among the Scottish people, we are informed by
the Registrar-General, there is a peculiar fondness for
marrying on the last day of the year. Indeed, there
are more marriages in Scotland on that day than in
any week of the year, excepting, of course, the week
in which that day occurs. Thus, in the year 1861,
the returns give the number of marriages in the eight
principal towns as averaging about twenty-five a day,
exclusive of Sunday, as marrying is one of the things
not to be done on this day in Scotland. On the 31st of
December, however, in the same towns there were
between 400 and 500 marriages. Curious to say, too,
in Scotland, Friday seems to be considered a lucky
day for weddings; for Mr. Watson, the City Chamberlain
of Glasgow, affirms that "it is a well-established
fact that nine-tenths of the marriages in Glasgow are
celebrated on a Friday; only a few on Tuesday and
Wednesday; Saturday and Monday are still more
rarely adopted, and I have never heard of such a thing
in Glasgow as a marriage on Sunday."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving seasons and days considered propitious
for marriage, we find, in the next place, a number of
superstitions associated with that prominent and all-important
personage on such an occasion, the bride.
Thus it is above all things necessary that the sun
should shine on her&mdash;"Blest is the bride that the sun
shines on!"&mdash;a notion, indeed, which, it has been
suggested, had a practical application in years gone by
when marriages were celebrated in the church porch.
A wet day, at such a time, was a serious matter,
especially as our forefathers had not the many contrivances
of modern times for preservation from rain.
Whereas, now-a-days, young ladies when alluding to
being married speak of "going to church," formerly
they spoke of "visiting the church-porch." After
prevailing for centuries, this ancient usage was discountenanced,
if not actually abolished, by the
ecclesiastical reformers of Edward VI.'s reign, who
"ordained that the performance of the binding ceremony
should take place in the body of the church."
Referring again to the bride, it is deemed absolutely
necessary by very many that she should weep on her
wedding-day, if it be only a few tears, the omission
of such an act being considered ominous of her future
happiness. It is, too, the height of ill-luck for either
the bride or the bridegroom to meet a funeral on going
to or coming from the church, for if it happen to be
that of a female, it is an indication that the bride will
not live long, and if it should be that of a male, then
the bridegroom is doomed to an early death. In the
North of England there is a strong prejudice against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a marriage taking place while there is a grave open in
the churchyard. In many parts of the country, also,
special care is taken that the bees are informed
of a wedding, and as a mark of respect to them
their hives are decorated with a favour. In
Sussex a bride on her return home from church is
often robbed of all the pins about her dress by the
single women present, from a belief that whoever
possesses one of them will be married in the course
of a year. Much excitement and amusement are
occasionally caused by the youthful competitors for
this supposed charm; and the bride herself is not
unfrequently the victim of rather rough treatment.
According to another piece of superstition, the bride,
in removing her bridal robe and chaplet at the completion
of the marriage ceremonies, must take care to
throw away every pin worn on this eventful day. Evil
fortune, it is affirmed, will sooner or later inevitably
overtake the bride who keeps even one pin used in
the marriage toilet. Woe also to the bridesmaids if
they retain one of them, as their chances of marriage
will thereby be materially lessened, and anyhow they
must give up all hope of being wedded before the
following Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>Again, in some parts of Yorkshire, to rub shoulders
with the bride or bridegroom is considered an augury
of a speedy marriage; and a piece of folk-lore
prevalent in the neighbourhood of Hull is to this
effect: "Be sure when you go to get married that
you don't go in at one door and out at another, or you
will always be unlucky." Cuthbert Bede, in "Notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and Queries," records an instance of a similar superstition
that occurred at a wedding in a Worcestershire
village in October, 1877. He says, "The bride and
bridegroom at the conclusion of the ceremony left the
church by the chancel door, instead of following the
usual custom of walking down the church and through
the nave door. One of the oldest inhabitants, in
mentioning this to me, said that it 'betokened bad
luck,' and that she had never known a like instance
but once in her life when the married couple went
out of the church through the chancel door, and the
bride was a widow before the twelve months was
out."</p>

<p>Alluding briefly to other superstitions associated
with marriage, we are told in the North of England
that she who receives from the bride a piece of cheese,
cut by her before leaving the table, will be the next
bride among the company. In Yorkshire, too, when
a newly-married couple first enter their house, a hen
is brought and made to cackle as a sign of good luck.
The old Roman practice, also, of lifting the bride
over the threshold of her husband's home, had its
counterpart in Scotland within the present century,
it being customary to lift the young wife over the
doorstep, lest any witchcraft or evil eye should be
cast upon and influence her. Indeed, we are informed
that the same practice prevailed in the North of
England some years ago&mdash;an interesting survival of
the primitive superstitions of our ancestors.</p>

<p>Another curious custom which was once practised
in different parts of the country was that of the elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sister dancing in a hog's trough in consequence of the
younger sister marrying before her. "Upon one
occasion," says Mr. Glyde in his "Norfolk Garland,"
"a brother went through the ceremony also; and the
dancers performed their part so well that the trough
itself was danced to pieces." It was considered the
most correct thing to dance in green stockings. It
was also customary in former years for elder sisters to
dance barefooted at the marriage of a younger one,
as otherwise they would inevitably become old maids.
Hence Katharine says to her father, in allusion to
Bianca:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"She is your treasure, she must have a husband.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must dance barefoot on her wedding-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for your love to her lead apes in hell."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last line, the meaning of which, however, is
somewhat obscure, expresses a common belief as to
the ultimate fate of old maids. Malone, on this
passage, remarks that in Shakespeare's time "to lead
apes" was one of the employments of a bear-ward,
who often carried about one of those animals along
with his bear.</p>

<p>Referring in the next place to some of the chief
ceremonies associated with marriage, we may note
that "the putting up of the banns" is not without
its superstitions, for in the North of England it is
considered highly unlucky for a young woman to be
present at church when this important event takes
place, any children she may hereafter have running
the terrible risk of being born deaf and dumb. Thus,
a Worcestershire girl, some years since, refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
attend church and hear the publication of her own
banns, lest by doing so she should bring the curse
of dumbness on her offspring. She stated that one
of her friends had transgressed this rule "by hearing
herself asked out at church," and in due course
had six children, all of whom were deaf and dumb.
Again, the wedding-cake, without which no wedding
would be considered complete, is evidently a survival
of the symbolical corn-ears originally worn by the
bride, and which in after-times were made into cakes
and sprinkled upon the bride's head. In course of
time these cakes were by degrees converted into one
large mass, enriched with almond paste; and that the
ingredients of a wedding-cake in the seventeenth
century did not differ materially from one at the
present day may be gathered from Herrick, who
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"This day, my Julia, thou must make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For mistress bride, the wedding-cake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knead but the dough, and it will be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To paste of almonds turned by thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or kiss it thou but once or twice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the bride-cake there'll be spice."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Indeed, corn in one form or another has always
entered into the marriage-ceremony, a practice which,
as Sir John Lubbock, in his "Origin of Civilisation,"
has pointed out, may be found among remote savages
or semi-civilised people. It would be difficult to
enumerate the many superstitions, beliefs, and usages
that have at different times clustered round the
wedding-cake, some of which are as popular as ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
In days gone by, either corn ears or fragments of
broken biscuit or cake were dropped on the newly-married
couple on their return from church, a custom
which is still kept up in some country districts. In
Scotland and the North of England, for instance, as
soon as the bride returns to her new home, one of
the oldest inhabitants, who has been stationed on the
threshold in readiness, throws a plateful of shortbread
over her head, taking care that it falls outside
the house. This is immediately scrambled for, as it
is considered most fortunate to secure a piece, however
small. Thus, just a century ago, Smollett, in his
"Expedition of Humphrey Clinker" (1771), described
how Mrs. Tabitha Lismahago's wedding-cake was
broken over her head, and its fragments distributed
among the bystanders, who imagined that to eat one
of the hallowed pieces would insure the unmarried
eater the delight of seeing in a vision the person to be
his wife or her husband. Numerous other divinations,
also, have been practised by means of wedding-cake,
one of the most popular being that of passing
it through a wedding-ring, and placing it under the
pillow to dream upon. In some parts of Lancashire
and Cumberland it is customary to put a ring amongst
the ingredients of the wedding-cake, and to invite the
guests in turn to cut a slice. The person who is
fortunate enough to hold the knife when it comes
upon the hidden ring is considered to be sure of
happiness during the ensuing twelve months. Again,
Mr. Henderson mentions an exciting custom practised
in the North at the wedding-feast. He says:&mdash;"The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bride sticks her knife into the cheese, and all at table
endeavour to seize it. He who succeeds without
cutting his fingers in the struggle thereby insures
happiness in his married life. The knife is called
'the best man's prize,' because the 'best man'
generally secures it. Should he fail to do so, he will
indeed be unfortunate in his matrimonial views. The
knife is, at any rate, a prize for male hands only;
the maidens try to possess themselves of a 'shaping'
of the wedding-dress, for use in certain divinations
regarding their future husbands." The custom of
throwing the shoe for luck at a bridal couple we shall
notice elsewhere, a practice which is perhaps the
principal source of merry-making and fun at most
weddings. We must not omit to allude to that indispensable
little article at a marriage, the wedding-ring,
concerning which so much has been written. The
Puritans, it may be remembered, tried to abolish it,
on account of, as they thought, its superstitious and
heathen origin. Thus, Butler, in his "Hudibras,"
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Others were for abolishing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tool of matrimony, a ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which the unsanctified bridegroom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is marry'd only to a thumb."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Though, however, the ring of gold is generally looked
upon as a necessity in the marriage-ceremony, yet it
is not legally so, but there is a very strong prejudice
against being married without it, and it would be no
easy task to find a couple brave enough to act in
opposition to this universal superstition. Thus, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
way of example, Mr. Jeaffreson, in his "Brides and
Bridals," tells us that the poor Irishman is so convinced
that a marriage lacks validity unless it has
been solemnised with a golden ring, that, when he
is too needy to buy a circlet of the most precious
metal, he hires a hoop of gold for use on his wedding-day.
Not long since a tradesman, in a market town
at Munster, made a considerable addition to his
modest income by letting out rings of gold to persons
about to marry, who restored the trinkets to their
owner after being wedded at church. A case is related,
on the other hand, of a party that came to the
church and requested to be married with a church
key. It was "a parish wedding," and the parish
authorities, though willing to pay the church fees,
because, as the account runs, "they were glad to get
rid of the girl," had not felt disposed to provide the
wedding-ring. The clerk, however, feeling some hesitation
as to the substitution of the church key,
stepped into a neighbouring house, and there borrowed
an old <i>curtain ring</i>, with which the marriage
was solemnised. Again, most ladies are especially
particular in their notions respecting their wedding-ring,
objecting under any pretence to take it off from
their finger, extending, it would seem, the expression
of "till death us do part," even to this pledge and
token of matrimony.</p>

<p>In various parts of the country we find many a
curious marriage custom, of which, however, we can
only give one or two instances. Thus, in some parts
of Kent, it was formerly customary to strew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
pathway to the church of the bridal couple, not with
flowers, but with emblems of the bridegroom's trade.
A carpenter, for instance, walked on shavings, a
paperhanger on slips of paper, a blacksmith on pieces
of old iron, and so on. In some parts of Durham the
bridal party was, in days gone by, generally escorted to
church by men armed with guns, which they fired
again and again in honour of the festive occasion.
In Scotland there was an amusing custom, called
"Creeling the bridegroom." A basket or creel was
filled with heavy stones and fixed to the bridegroom's
shoulder, and with this burden he was obliged to run
about until his wife unfastened the creel.</p>

<small>DEATH AND BURIAL.</small></h2>

<p class="hang">Warnings of Death&mdash;The Howling of Dogs&mdash;A Cow in the Garden&mdash;Death-presaging

<p>The superstitions associated with the last stage of
human life are most numerous; and that this should
be so is not surprising when it is considered how,
from the earliest time, a certain dread has been
attached to death, not only on account of its awful
mysteriousness, but owing to its being the crisis of an
entirely new phase of the soul's existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Commencing then with popular omens, it may be
noted that every incident out of the common course
of natural events is looked upon by the superstitious
as indicative of approaching death. Hence we find
the credulous ever conjuring up in their minds
imaginary prognostications of this sad occurrence,
which, apart from the needless terror they cause,
are based on no foundation of truth. Foremost
among these is the howling of a dog at night, a
superstition which, while not confined to our own
country, appears to have been almost as well known
in ancient times as at the present day. As a plea,
however, for its prevalence, even among the educated,
we might urge that it is not unnatural for the mind,
when unstrung and overbalanced by the presence of
sickness and impending death, to be over-sensitive,
and to take notice of every little sound and sight
which may seem to connect themselves with its
anxiety. Out of the innumerable instances which
are recorded in our own country respecting this
popular superstition, may be mentioned one which
happened a few years ago at Worthing. It appears
that no slight consternation was caused by a Newfoundland
dog, the property of a clergyman in the
neighbourhood, lying down on the steps of a house
and howling piteously, refusing to be driven away.
As soon as it was known that a young lady, long an
invalid, had died there, so much excitement took place
that news of the occurrence reached the owner of the
dog, who came to Worthing to inquire into the truth
of it. Unfortunately, however, for the lovers of and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
believers in the marvellous, it eventually turned out
that the dog had by accident been separated from his
master late in the evening, and had been seen running
here and there in search of him, and howling at the
door of the stable where he put up his horse, and
other places which he often visited in Worthing. It
happened, moreover, that his master had been in the
habit of visiting the particular house where the young
lady had died, which at once accounted for the
apparent mystery. In the same way, indeed, other
similar instances of this superstition might be easily
cleared up, if only properly investigated at the time
of the occurrence. The howling of the dog is ascribed
by some to its keen sense of the odour of approaching
mortal dissolution; whereas others affirm that this
animal can see the spirits which hover round the house
of sickness, ready at the moment of death to bear away
the soul of the departed one to its distant home. In
Aryan mythology the dog is said to see ghosts, and in
Germany, at the present day, a dog howling before a
house portends either a death or a fire. In Wales,
it is thought that horses, too, have the gift of
seeing spirits. Carriage-horses, it is said, have
been known to display every sign of the utmost
terror, although the occupants of the carriage could
see no cause for alarm. Such an occurrence is considered
highly ominous, and thought to forebode that
a funeral will soon pass by that way, bearing to his
resting-place some person not dead at the time of the
horse's fright.</p>

<p>Whilst speaking of animals in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
death, it may be noted that an ox or a cow breaking
into a garden is an omen of death. In illustration of
this notion a correspondent of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> relates
the following narrative as written down by himself
about the time to which it relates. He says, "Though
I laugh at the superstition, the omen was painfully
fulfilled in my case. About the middle of March,
1843, some cattle were driven close to my house, and
the back door being open, three got into our little bit
of garden, and trampled it. When our school-drudge
came in the afternoon, and asked the cause of the
confusion, she expressed great sorrow and apprehension
on being told&mdash;said that it was a bad sign&mdash;that
we should hear of three deaths within the next six
months. Alas! in April we heard of dear J&mdash;&mdash;'s
murder; a fortnight after A&mdash;&mdash; died; and to-morrow,
August 10th, I attend the funeral of my excellent
son-in-law. I have just heard of the same omen from
another quarter. But what is still more remarkable
is that when I went down to Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;'s burial, and
was mentioning the superstition, they told me that
while he was lying ill, a cow got into the front garden
and was driven out with great difficulty. It is still a
common saying in Scotland, when any one is dangerously
ill, and not likely to recover, 'The black ox
has trampled upon him.'"</p>

<p>Another common omen of death is the hovering of
birds around a house, and their tapping against the
window-pane. Amongst the death-presaging birds may
be mentioned the raven, the crow, and the swallow.
The crowing of the cock, also, at the dead of night is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
regarded as equally ominous. The appearance of a
jackdaw is in some parts of the country much
dreaded. Thus a correspondent of <cite>Notes and
Queries</cite> tells us, that a stonemason at Clifton related
to him an accident that happened to a workman at
the suspension bridge over the Avon, at the time
when the river was simply spanned by a single chain,
placing much emphasis on the fact that a single jackdaw
had been noticed by some of the workmen perched
upon the centre of the chain, and had been regarded
by them as a precursor of death. We must not omit
the evil reputation of the owl and the magpie; and
a well-known superstition current in some parts that
to catch a sparrow and keep it confined in a cage is
an omen of death. Once more, it is a bad sign when
an invalid asks for a dish of pigeons to eat, such an
occurrence being considered an omen of his approaching
death. Some also affirm that if one hears the
cuckoo's first note when in bed, illness or death is
certain to come upon the hearer or one of his family.
If any one be about to die suddenly, or lose a relation,
the cuckoo will light upon a piece of touchwood, or
rotten bough, and <i>cuckoo</i>.</p>

<p>Plants, in the next place, are sometimes regarded as
ominous of approaching mortality. When, for example,
an apple-tree or pear-tree blooms twice in the year it
denotes a death in the family. If, too, green broom
be picked when in bloom it is believed that the
father or mother will die in the course of the year.
Mrs. Latham, in her "West Sussex Superstitions,"
gives the following touching little anecdote:&mdash;"A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
poor girl, who was lingering in the last stage of consumption,
but whose countenance had always lighted
up with pleasure at the sight of flowers, appeared one
morning so exceedingly restless and unhappy after a
fresh nosegay of gay spring flowers had been laid
upon her bed, that I asked her if the scent of them
was disagreeable to her. 'Oh, no!' she exclaimed,
'they are very nice indeed to smell; but yet I should
be very glad if you would throw away that piece of
yellow broom; for they do say that death comes with
it if it is brought into the house in blossom during
the month of May.'" According to a Yorkshire superstition,
if a child gathers the germander speedwell its
mother will die during the year; and others consider
it equally unlucky to bring the first snowdrop of the
year into the house. To dream that a tree is uprooted
in one's garden is regarded as a death-warning to the
owner. Indeed plants may be said to hold an important
place in the folk-lore of death, so many
curious legends and quaint superstitions having
clustered round them both in ancient and modern
times. Thus, to quote one further instance, if yew
is accidentally brought into the house at Christmas
among the evergreens, it is looked upon as a sign that
a death will occur in the family before the end of the
year.</p>

<p>Among other omens of death, may be noticed
the will-o'-the-wisp, which has on this account been
much dreaded, its undulating movement being carefully
observed, from an anxiety to ascertain in which
direction it disappears, as it is supposed to be&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The hateful messenger of heavy things,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of death and dolour telling"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>to the inhabitants of the house nearest that spot. We
have heard also of an occasion in which considerable
uneasiness was created by a pale light moving over the
bed of a sick person, and after flickering for some time
in different parts of the room to vanish through the
window. It happened, however, that the mystery
was cleared up soon afterwards, for, on a similar light
appearing, it was found to proceed from a luminous
insect, which proved to be the male glow-worm. In
the same way the "corpse-candles" in Wales, also
called the "fetch-lights," or "dead man's candles," are
regarded as forerunners of death. Sometimes this
unlucky sign appears in the form of a plain yellow
candle, in the hand of a ghost, and at other times it
looks like "a stately flambeau, stalking along unsupported,
burning with ghastly blue flame." It is
considered highly dangerous to interfere with this
fatal portent, and persons who have attempted to
check its course are reported to have been severely
afflicted in consequence, many being actually struck
down on the spot where they stood as a punishment
for their audacity.</p>

<p>There is a popular idea prevalent in Lancashire
that to build or even to rebuild a house is always
fatal to one member of the family&mdash;generally to the
one who may have been the principal promoter of the
plans for the building or alteration. Again, we are
also told how the household clock has been known to
depart from its customary precision in order to warn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
its owner of approaching death by striking <i>thirteen</i>.
A clergyman relates that one evening he called on an
old friend more than eighty years of age, who had lost
her husband about six months before. Whilst sitting
with her he heard the clock strike the hour in an
adjoining room, and counted it <i>seven</i>. Being surprised
that it was no later he involuntarily took out his watch,
and found that it was in reality <i>eight</i> o'clock. The
old lady noticing this remarked, "Ah! the clock lost
a stroke against my poor husband's death, and I have
not altered it since."</p>

<p>According to another very common superstition
there seems to be a kind of sympathy and harmony
between two personalities, whereby dying persons
themselves announce their departure to their friends
in certain mysterious ways. Countless instances
are on record of such supposed forebodings of death.
A curious and interesting example of this species of
folk-lore happened not so very long ago, in connection
with the lamented death of Mr. George Smith, the
eminent Assyriologist. This famous scholar died at
Aleppo, on the 19th of August, 1876, at or about the
hour of six in the afternoon. On the same day, and
at about the same time, a friend and fellow-worker of
Mr. Smith's&mdash;Dr. Delitzsch&mdash;was passing within a
stone's-throw of the house in which Mr. Smith had
lived whilst in London, when he suddenly heard his
own name uttered aloud in a "most piercing cry,"
which, says <cite>The Daily News</cite> (Sept. 12th, 1876)
thrilled him to the marrow. The fact impressed him
so strongly that he looked at his watch, noted the hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and, although he did not mention the circumstance at
the time, recorded it in his note-book.</p>

<p>Again, as a further illustration, we are told how
on board one of Her Majesty's ships lying off Portsmouth,
the officers being one day at mess, a young
lieutenant suddenly laid down his knife and fork,
pushed away his plate, and turned extremely pale.
He then rose from the table, covered his face with his
hands, and retired. The president of the mess, supposing
him to be ill, sent to make inquiries. At first he was
unwilling to reply; but on being pressed he confessed
that he had been seized by a sudden and irresistible
impression that a brother he had in India was dead.
"He died," said he, "on the 12th August, at six
o'clock; I am perfectly convinced of it." No argument
could overthrow his conviction, which in due
course of time was verified to the letter. Events
of this kind, which in the minds of many seem to
point to a mysterious sympathy between two individuals,
are explained by others as simply the result
of "fancy and coincidence." Any one, it is argued,
may fall into a brown study, and emerge from it with
a stare, and the notion that he heard his name spoken.
That is the part of fancy, and the simultaneous event
is the part of coincidence. Against this theory
it will always be argued that these coincidences are
too many to be accidental, and this position, as a
writer in <cite>The Daily News</cite> has shown, will generally
be met by counter-efforts to weaken the evidence for
each individual case, and so to reduce the cumulative
evidence to nothing. Taking into consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
however, the countless instances which are on record
of this kind, many of them apparently resting on evidence
beyond impeachment, we must, whilst allotting to
them the credence they deserve, honestly admit they
are occasionally beyond the limits of human explanation.</p>

<p>From a very early period there has existed a belief
in the existence of the power of prophecy at that
period which precedes death. It probably took its
origin in the assumed fact that the soul becomes
divine in the same rate as the connection with the
body is loosened. It has been urged in support of
this theory that at the hour of death the soul is, as
it were, on the confines of two worlds, and may possibly
at the same moment possess a power which is both
prospective and retrospective. Shakespeare in his
<cite>Richard II.</cite> (Act ii., sc. 1) makes the dying Gaunt,
alluding to his nephew, the young and self-willed king,
exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Methinks I am a prophet new inspired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus expiring do foretell of him."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again in <cite>1 Henry IV.</cite> (Act v., sc. 4), the brave
Percy, when in the agonies of death, conveys the same
idea in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"O, I could prophesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that the earthy and cold hand of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies on my tongue."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some have sought for the foundation of this
belief in the forty-ninth chapter of Genesis:&mdash;"And
Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
together, that I may tell you that which shall befall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
you in the last days. And when Jacob had made an
end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet
into his bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was
gathered unto his people." This notion has not died
out, but still prevails in Lancashire and other parts
of England.</p>

<p>Referring to death itself, there is a widespread
belief that deaths mostly occur during the ebbing of
the tide: a superstition to which Charles Dickens has
so touchingly alluded in "David Copperfield." While
the honest-hearted Mr. Peggotty sat by the bedside
of poor Barkis, and watched life's flame gradually
growing dimmer, he said to David Copperfield, "People
can't die along the coast except when the tide's
pretty nigh out. They can't be born unless it's pretty
nigh in. Not properly born till flood. He's agoing
out with the tide&mdash;he's agoing out with the tide.
It's ebb at half-arter three, slack water half an hour.
If he lives till it turns, he'll hold his own till past
the flood, and go out with the next tide." And after
many hours' watching, "it being low water, he went
out with the tide."</p>

<p>Persons, too, are said to "die hard," to quote a
popular phrase, or, in other words, to have a painful
and prolonged death, when there are pigeons' feathers
in the bed. Hence, some will not allow dying persons
to lie on a feather bed at all, maintaining that it very
much increases the pain, and retards the inevitable
crisis of their departure. Many, on the other hand,
have a superstitious feeling that it is a great misfortune,
nay, even a judgment, not to die in a bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Many are the anecdotes illustrative of the former
superstition, one or two of which we will quote.
Thus a Sussex nurse one day told the wife of her
clergyman that "never did she see any one die so
hard as old Master Short; and at last she thought
(though his daughter said there were none) that there
must be game-feathers in the bed. She, therefore,
tried to pull it from under him, but he was a heavy
man and she could not manage it alone, and there was
no one with him but herself, and so she got a rope
and tied it round him and pulled him by it off the
bed, and he went off in a minute quite comfortable,
just like a lamb." Again, one day, when an old woman
near Yarmouth was speaking of the burning of game-feathers
as a precaution in case of death, her neighbours
said to her, "Of course we don't believe that
can have anything to do with a hard death," whereupon
she replied, "Then you yourself use such
feathers." "Oh, no; we always burn them, unless
we want them for a chair-cushion." The same notion
prevails in Yorkshire with regard to cocks' feathers.
According to another popular fancy a person cannot
die comfortably under the cross-beam of a house, and
we are told of the case of a man of whom it was said
at his death, that after many hours' hard dying, being
removed from the position under the cross-beam, he
departed peaceably.</p>

<p>Again, the interval between death and burial has
generally been associated with various superstitious
fears and practices. Thus, as soon as the corpse is
laid out there is still a widespread custom of placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a plate of salt upon the breast, the reason being
no doubt to prevent the body swelling; although
there is a belief that it acts as a charm against
any attempt on the part of evil spirits to disturb the
body. Pennant tells us that formerly in Scotland,
"the corpse being stretched on a board and covered
with a coarse linen wrapper, the friends laid on the
breast of the deceased a wooden platter, containing a
small quantity of salt and earth, separate and unmixed;
the earth an emblem of the corruptible body,
the salt as an emblem of the immortal spirit." Mr.
Napier, in his "Folk-Lore of the West of Scotland,"
points out that we may find another explanation for
the plate of salt on the breast in the "sin-eaters,"
persons who, in days gone by, when a person died,
were sent for to come and eat the sins of the deceased.
On their arrival their first act was to place a plate of
salt and one of bread on the breast of the corpse,
repeating a series of incantations, after which they
devoured the contents of the plates. By this ceremony
the deceased person was supposed to be
relieved of such sins as would have kept his spirit
hovering about his relations to their discomfort and
annoyance.</p>

<p>It is customary, especially among the poor, for
those who visit a house while the dead body is lying
in it to touch the corpse, thereby showing that they
owe the departed one no grudge. This practice, in
all probability, originated in the belief that a corpse
would bleed at the touch of the murderer, constant
allusions to which we find in old authors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The practice of watching the dead body until its
burial is not yet obsolete, a custom indeed which,
among the Irish, is even still occasionally the scene
of the most unseemly revelries, those present oftentimes
indulging in excessive drinking and riotous
merry-making. In days gone by, however, this practice
was attended with every mark of respect to the
deceased one, the leading idea being to see that the
devil did not carry off the body.</p>

<p>Lastly, since the formation of cemeteries, many of
the quaint old funeral customs which formerly existed
in many of our country villages have passed away.
Now-a-days, the "last act," as the committal of the
body to the grave has been termed, has been shorn of
much of its pomp. Thus, in the North of England
it was customary, only a few years ago, to carry "the
dead with the sun" to the grave, a practice corresponding
with the Highland usage of making "the deazil,"
or walking three times round a person, according to
the course of the sun. On one occasion, in the village
of Stranton, near West Hartlepool, the vicar was
standing at the churchyard gate, awaiting the
arrival of the funeral procession, when, much to his
surprise, the entire group, who had come within a few
yards of him, suddenly turned back and marched
round the churchyard wall, thus traversing its west,
north, and east boundaries. On inquiring the reason
of this extraordinary procedure, one of the mourners
quickly replied, "Why, ye wad no hae them carry the
dead again the sun; the dead maun ay go wi' the
sun." This is not unlike a Welsh custom mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
by Pennant, who tells us that when a corpse was conveyed
to the churchyard from any part of the town,
great care was always taken that it should be carried
the whole distance on the right-hand side of the road.
A curious custom, which still survives at Welsh
funerals, is termed "the parson's penny." After
reading the burial service in the church, the clergyman
stands behind a table while a psalm is being
sung. In the meantime each of the mourners places a
piece of money on the table for his acceptance. This
ceremony is regarded as a token of respect to the
deceased, although it was no doubt originally intended
to compensate the clergyman for praying for the soul
of the departed. In some Welsh parishes a similar
custom, called "spade-money," is observed. As soon
as the corpse has been committed to its resting-place,
the grave-digger presents his spade as a receptacle for
donations, these offerings, which often amount to a
goodly sum, being regarded as his perquisites.</p>

<p>From time immemorial there has been a popular
prejudice among the inhabitants of rural villages
against "burial without the sanctuary." This does not
imply in unconsecrated ground, but on the north side
of the church, or in a remote corner of the churchyard.
The origin of this repugnance is said to have
been the notion that the northern part was that which
was appropriated to the interment of unbaptised infants,
excommunicated persons, or such as had laid
violent hands upon themselves. Hence it was generally
known as "the wrong side of the church." In
many parishes, therefore, this spot remained unoccupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
while the remaining portion of the churchyard
was crowded. White, in his "History of
Selborne," alluding to this superstition, says that as
most people wished to be buried on the south side of
the churchyard, it became such a mass of mortality
that no person could be interred "without disturbing
or displacing the bones of his ancestors." A clergyman
of a rural parish in Norfolk says:&mdash;"If I were
on any occasion to urge a parishioner to inter a deceased
relative on the north side of the church, he
would answer me with some expression of surprise,
if not of offence, at the proposal, 'No, sir, it is not
in the sanctuary.'"</p>

<p>Great attention has, also, generally been paid to
the position of the grave, the popular idea being
from east to west, while that from north to south
has been considered not only dishonourable, but
unlucky. Indeed, the famous antiquary, Thomas
Hearne, was so particular on this point that he left
orders for his grave to be made straight by a compass,
due east and west. In <cite>Cymbeline</cite> (Act iv., sc. 2),
Guiderius, speaking of the apparently dead body of
Imogen disguised in man's apparel, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father hath a reason for 't."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is worthy of notice that the burial of the dead
among the Greeks was in the line of east and west;
and thus it is not to late and isolated fancy, but to
the carrying on of ancient and widespread solar ideas,
as Mr. Tylor has so clearly shown, that we trace the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
well-known legend that the body of Christ was laid
towards the east, and the Christian usage of digging
graves east and west. A pretty custom was once
observed in many of our country villages at the funeral
of a young unmarried girl, or of a bride who died
in her honeymoon; a chaplet of flowers being carried
before the corpse by a girl nearest in age, size, and
resemblance, and afterwards hung up in the church
over the accustomed seat of the deceased.</p>

<p>Among other customs connected with burial may
be mentioned "funeral feasts," which have prevailed
in this and other countries from the earliest times,
and are supposed to have been borrowed from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C&oelig;na feralis</i> of the Romans: an offering, consisting of
milk, honey, wine, aloes, and strewed flowers, to the
ghost of the deceased. In a variety of forms this
custom has prevailed amongst most nations, the idea
being that the spirits of the dead feed on the viands
set before them. In Christian times, however, these
funeral offerings have passed into commemorative
banquets, under which form they still exist amongst
us. In the north of England the funeral feast is
called "an arval," and the loaves that are sometimes
distributed among the poor are termed "arval bread."</p>

<p>The poor seem to have always been fond of inviting
a large number of friends to attend a funeral. Instances
are on record of a barrel of beer, two gallons
of sack, and four gallons of claret being consumed at
a funeral, and the cost of wine has been five times
more than the cost of the coffin. In one of the
parishes on the borders of Norfolk there is a tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
says Mr. Glyde in his "Norfolk Garland," that when
the warrior Sir Robert Atte Tye was buried, four
dozen of wine were drunk, according to his last
directions, over his grave, before the coffin was
covered with earth. Many curious anecdotes might
be given of funerals having been solemnised within
the church-porch, and of the scruples entertained by
great men as to the practice of interment in churches.
A part of the churchyard, too, was occasionally left
unconsecrated for the purpose of burying excommunicated
persons. Among some of the superstitions
associated with burial we may just note that it is
considered by some unlucky to meet a funeral; and
that, according to another notion, the ghost of the last
person buried keeps watch over the churchyard till
another is buried, to whom he delivers his charge.</p>

<small>THE HUMAN BODY.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Superstitions about Deformity, Moles, &amp;c.&mdash;Tingling of the Ear&mdash;The
Nose&mdash;The Eye&mdash;The Teeth&mdash;The Hair&mdash;The Hand&mdash;Dead
Man's Hand&mdash;The Feet.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the preceding pages we have given a brief survey
of that widespread folk-lore with which the life of
man has been invested, stage by stage, from the cradle
to the grave. In like manner the popular imagination
has, in most countries from the earliest times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
woven round the human body a thick network of
superstitions, many of which, while of the nature of
omens, are supposed to indicate certain facts, such as
the person's character, the events connected with his
life, and to give that insight into his future career
which eager curiosity would strive to ascertain. Thus,
according to an old prejudice, which is not quite
extinct, those who are defective or deformed are
marked by nature as prone to mischief, in accordance
with which notion Shakespeare makes Margaret,
speaking of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, in <cite>King
Richard III.</cite> (Act i., sc. 3), say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rotting hog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou that was seal'd in thy nativity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slave of nature and the son of hell."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Moles, too, have generally been thought to denote good
or ill-luck from their position on the body. Thus one
on the throat is a sign of luck, but one on the left side
of the forehead near the hair is just the reverse. Again,
a mole on either the chin, ear, or neck is an indication
of riches, but one on the breast signifies poverty.
Indeed, if we are to believe the "Greenwich Fortune-teller,"
a popular chap-book in former years, omens to
be drawn from moles are almost unlimited.</p>

<p>Referring, however, more especially to the folk-lore
associated with the different parts of the human body,
this, as we have already stated, is very extensive,
being in many cases the legacy bequeathed to us by
our ancestors. Commencing, then, with the ear,
there is a well-known superstition that a tingling of
the right one is lucky, denoting that a friend is speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
well of one; a tingling of the left implying the
opposite. This notion differs according to the locality,
as in some places it is the tingling of the left ear which
denotes the friend, and the tingling of the right ear
the enemy. Shakespeare, in <cite>Much Ado about Nothing</cite>
(Act iii., sc. 1), makes Beatrice say to Ursula and
Hero, who had been talking of her, "What fire
is in mine ears?" in allusion, it is generally supposed,
to this popular fancy, which is old as the
time of Pliny, who says, "When our ears tingle some
one is talking of us in our absence." Sir Thomas
Browne also ascribes the idea to the belief in guardian
angels, who touch the right or left ear according as
the conversation is favourable or not to the person.
The Scotch peasantry have an omen called the "death-bell"&mdash;a
tingling in the ears which is believed to
announce some friend's death. Hogg alludes to this
superstition in his "Mountain Bard":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"O lady, 'tis dark, an' I heard the death-bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I darena gae yonder for gowd nor fee,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>and gives also an amusing anecdote illustrative of
it:&mdash;"Our two servant-girls agreed to go on an
errand of their own, one night after supper, to a
considerable distance, from which I strove to persuade
them, but could not prevail; so, after going to the
apartment where I slept, I took a drinking-glass, and
coming close to the back of the door made two or
three sweeps round the lip of the glass with my
finger, which caused a loud shrill sound, and then
overheard the following dialogue:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>B.</i> 'Ah, mercy! the dead-bell went through my
head just now with such a knell as I never heard.'</p>

<p>"<i>I.</i> 'I heard it too.'</p>

<p>"<i>B.</i> 'Did you indeed? That is remarkable. I
never knew of two hearing it at the same time
before.'</p>

<p>"<i>I.</i> 'We will not go to Midgehope to-night.'</p>

<p>"<i>B.</i> 'I would not go for all the world! I shall
warrant it is my poor brother Wat. Who knows
what these wild Irish may have done to him?'"</p>

<p>The itching of the nose, like that of the ears, is not
without its signification, denoting that a stranger will
certainly appear before many hours have passed by, in
allusion to which Dekker, in his "Honest Whore,"
says:&mdash;"We shall ha' guests to-day; my nose itcheth
so." In the north of England, however, if the nose
itches it is reckoned a sign that the person will
either be crossed, vexed, or kissed by a fool; whereas
an old writer tells us that "when a man's nose
itcheth it is a signe he shall drink wine." Many
omens, too, are gathered from bleeding of the nose.
Thus Grose says, "One drop of blood from the
nose commonly foretells death or a very severe fit of
sickness; three drops are still more ominous;" and
according to another notion one drop from the left
nostril is a sign of good luck, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Bleeding
of the nose seems also to have been regarded as a
sign of love, if we may judge from a passage in
Boulster's "Lectures," published early in the seventeenth
century:&mdash;"'Did my nose ever bleed when I
was in your company?' and, poor wretch, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
she spake this, to show her true heart, her nose
fell a-bleeding." Again, that bleeding of the nose
was looked upon as ominous in days gone by, we may
gather from Launcelot's exclamation in the <cite>Merchant
of Venice</cite> (Act ii., sc. 5), "It was not for nothing
that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at
six o'clock"&mdash;a superstition to which many of our
old writers refer. Among further superstitions
connected with the nose we may mention one in
Cornwall, known as "the blue vein," an illustration
of which occurs in Mr. Hunt's "Popular Romances of
the West of England," who relates the following little
anecdote:&mdash;"A fond mother was paying more than
ordinary attention to a fine healthy-looking child, a
boy about three years old. The poor woman's breast
was heaving with emotion, and she struggled to repress
her sighs. Upon inquiring if anything was really
wrong, she said, 'The old lady of the house had just
told her that the child could not live long because he
had a blue vein across his nose.'" This piece of folk-lore,
which caused the anxious mother such distress,
is not confined to the West of England, but crops up
here and there throughout the country. While speaking
of the nose, we may just note that it is the subject
of various proverbs. Thus "to put the nose out of
joint" means to supplant one in another's favour, and
the popular one of "paying through the nose," implying
extortion, may, it has been suggested, have
originated in a poll-tax levied by Odin, which was
called in Sweden a nose-tax, and was a penny per nose
or poll. Once more, we have the term "nose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
wax" applied to a person who is very accommodating,
and one may occasionally hear the phrase "wipe the
nose" used in the sense of affront.</p>

<p>Leaving the nose, however, we find similar odd
fancies attached to the eye. In many places we are
told that "it's a good thing to have meeting eyebrows,
as such a person will never know trouble," although,
curious to say, on the Continent quite a different
significance is attributed to this peculiarity. In Greece,
for instance, it is held as an omen that the man is a
vampire, and in Denmark and Germany it is said to
indicate that he is a werewolf. In China, also, there is
a proverb that "people whose eyebrows meet can never
expect to attain to the dignity of a minister of state."
There can be no doubt that, according to the general
idea, meeting eyebrows are not considered lucky:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Trust not the man whose eyebrows meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in his heart you'll find deceit."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus, Charles Kingsley, in "Two Years Ago,"
speaks of this idea in the following passage:&mdash;"Tom
began carefully scrutinising Mrs. Harvey's face. It
had been very handsome. It was still very clever, but
the eyebrows clashed together downwards above her
nose, and rising higher at the outward corners,
indicated, as surely as the restless down-drop eye, a
character self-conscious, furtive, capable of great
inconsistencies, possibly of great deceit."</p>

<p>Again, the itching of the right eye is considered a
lucky omen, an idea that is very old, and may be traced
as far back as the time of Theocritus, who says:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"My right eye itches now, and I shall see my love."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the antiquary Grose, however, who
collected together so many of the superstitions prevalent
in his day, "When the right eye itches, the party
affected will shortly cry; if the left, they will laugh."
The power of fascination has generally been considered
to be a peculiar quality of the eye, a notion by no
means obsolete, and numerous charms have been
resorted to for counteracting its influence. In our
<a href="#CHAPTER_I">chapter on "Birth and Infancy"</a> we have already
spoken of the danger to which young children are said
to be subject from the malevolent power of some evil
eye, and of the pernicious effects resulting from it.
Shakespeare gives several references to it, one of which
occurs in the <cite>Merry Wives of Windsor</cite> (Act v., sc. 5),
where Pistol says of Falstaff:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth."</p>


<p>And once more, in <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite> (Act ii., sc. 1),
Aaron speaks of Tamora as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"&mdash;&mdash;fetter'd in amorous chains&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was not very long ago that a curious case of this
superstition was brought before the guardians of the
Shaftesbury Union, in which an applicant for relief
stated his inability to work because he had been
"overlooked" by his sister-in-law. Although his
wife had resorted for help to a wise-woman, yet she
was unable to remove the spell under which he lay,
and thus the unfortunate man, incapable of labour,
applied for relief, which he did not obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next place, some of the superstitions
connected with the teeth are quaint, and afford opportunities
to the credulous for drawing omens of various
kinds. Thus, to dream about teeth is held to be a
warning that sorrow of some kind is at hand; and
it is even unluckier still to dream of one's teeth falling
out. It is also frequently the custom, for the sake of
luck, to throw a tooth when extracted into the fire, a
practice which, as we have already seen, is frequently
most scrupulously kept up in the case of young
children, to make sure of the remainder of their teeth
coming properly. Furthermore, to have teeth wide
apart is a sign of prosperity, and is said to indicate
one's future happiness in life. As an instance of this
piece of folk-lore we may quote the following,
narrated by a correspondent in <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>:&mdash;"A
young lady the other day, in reply to an observation
of mine, 'What a lucky girl you are!' replied,
'So they used to say I should be when at school.'
'Why?' 'Because my teeth were set so far apart; it
was a sure sign I should be lucky and travel.'"
Trivial as many of these superstitions may seem,
yet they are interesting, inasmuch as they show how
minutely the imagination has at different times
surrounded the human body with countless items of
odd notions, some of which in all probability originated
from practical experience, while others have been
the result of a thousand circumstances, to ascertain
the history of which would be a matter of long and
elaborate research.</p>

<p>Passing on to the hair, there is a popular notion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sudden fright or violent distress will, to use Sir
Walter Scott's words, "blanch at once the hair."
Thus, in Shakespeare's <cite>1 Henry IV.</cite> (Act ii., sc. 4),
Falstaff, in his speech to Prince Henry, says:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"Thy father's beard is turned white with the news."</p>


<p>Although this has been styled "a whimsical notion,"
yet in its support various instances of its occurrence
have been from time to time recorded. The hair of Ludwig
of Bavaria, for example, it is said, became almost
suddenly white as snow on his learning the innocence
of his wife, whom he had caused to be put to death
on a suspicion of infidelity; and the same thing, we are
told, happened to Charles I. in a single night, when he
attempted to escape from Carisbrooke Castle. A similar
story is told of the unfortunate Marie Antoinette,
when her flight from France was checked at Varennes.
According to another notion, excessive fear has occasionally
caused the hair to stand on end, a belief which
Shakespeare has recorded. In <cite>Hamlet</cite> (Act iii., sc. 4),
in that famous passage where the Queen is at a loss to
understand her son's mysterious conduct and strange
appearance, during his conversation with the ghost
which is hidden to her eyes, she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starts up, and stands on end."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Once more, too, in that graphic scene in the <cite>Tempest</cite>
(Act i., sc. 2), where Ariel describes the shipwreck, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"All but mariners<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all afire with me; the king's son, Ferdinand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hair up-staring&mdash;then like reeds, not hair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the first man that leap'd."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The sudden loss of hair is considered unlucky, being
said to prognosticate the loss of children, health, or
property; whereas many consider it imprudent to
throw it away, or to leave the smallest scrap lying
about. One reason assigned for this notion is that
if hair is left about, birds might build their nests
with it, a fatal thing for the person from whose head
it has fallen. Thus, should a magpie use it for
any such purpose&mdash;by no means an unlikely circumstance&mdash;the
person's death will be sure to happen
"within a year and a day." Some say, again, that
hair should never be burnt, but only buried, a
superstition founded on a tradition that at the resurrection
its owner will come in search of it. On the
other hand, it is customary with some persons to
throw a piece of their hair into the fire, drawing
various omens from the way it burns. Should it
gradually smoulder away, it is an omen of death;
but its burning brightly is a sign of longevity, and the
brighter the flame the longer the life. In Devonshire,
too, if the hair grows down on the forehead and
retreats up the head above the temples, it is considered
an indication that the person will have a long life.
There is a very prevalent idea that persons who have
much hair or down on their arms are, to quote the
common expression, "born to be rich," although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
exception, in this as in many other similar cases,
rather proves the rule; but abundance of hair on the
head has been supposed to denote a lack of brains,
from whence arose an odd proverb, "Bush natural,
more hair than wit." Once more, Judas is said to
have had red hair, and hence, from time immemorial,
there has been a strong antipathy to it. Shakespeare,
in <cite>As You Like It</cite> (Act iii., sc. 4), alludes to this
belief, when he makes Rosalind say of Orlando:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"His very hair is of the dissembling colour."</p>


<p>To which Celia replies:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"Something browner than Judas's."</p>


<p>It has been conjectured, however, that the odium
attached to red hair took its origin in this country
from the aversion felt to the red-haired Danes. One
reason, perhaps, more than another why this dislike
to it arose, originated in the circumstance that the
colour was thought ugly and unfashionable, and the
antipathy to it, therefore, would naturally be increased
by this opinion. Thus, in course of time, a
red beard was also held in contempt, and was regarded
as an infallible token of a vile disposition. Yellow
hair, too, was formerly esteemed a deformity, and in
ancient tapestries both Cain and Judas are represented
with yellow beards, in allusion to which, in the
<cite>Merry Wives of Windsor</cite> (Act i., sc. 4), Simple, when
interrogated, says of his master, "He hath but a little
wee face, with a little yellow beard&mdash;a Cain-coloured
beard." While alluding to beards, we may note that
in former years they gave rise to various customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
many of which, however, have long ago fallen into
disuse. Thus, dyeing beards was a common practice,
and our readers may recollect how Bottom, in <cite>A
Midsummer Night's Dream</cite> (Act i., sc. 2), is perplexed
as to what beard he should wear in performing his
part before the Duke. He says, "I will discharge
it either in your straw-coloured beard, your orange-tawny
beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your
French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow." It
was evidently quite as much the habit for gentlemen
to dye their beards in Shakespeare's day as it
is said to be for ladies to dye their locks now-a-days.
When beards, too, were the fashion, to mutilate or
cut off one was considered an irreparable outrage.</p>

<p>Pursuing our subject, we find that the cheek is
not without its quota of folk-lore; for, like the ear,
nose, and eye, it is considered ominous when one's
cheek itches. According to Grose, "If the right
cheek burns, some one is speaking to the person's
advantage; if the left, to their disadvantage." One
may still occasionally hear the following charm
uttered by a person whose cheek suddenly burns:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Right cheek! left cheek! why do you burn?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cursed be she that doth me any harm;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If she be a maid, let her be staid;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If she be a widow, long let her mourn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if it be my own true love&mdash;burn, cheek, burn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, the hand has been honoured with a very
extensive folk-lore, and the following extract from an
old writer shows that nearly every peculiarity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
hand has been made emblematical of some personal
trait of character. Thus, we are told:&mdash;"A great
thick hand signifies one not only strong, but stout;
a little slender hand, one not only weak, but timorous;
a long hand and long fingers betoken a
man not only apt for mechanical artifice, but liberally
ingenious. Those short, on the contrary, note a fool,
and fit for nothing; a hard brawny hand signifies one
dull and rude; a soft hand, one witty, but effeminate;
a hairy hand, one luxurious. Long joints signify
generosity; yet, if they be thick withal, one not so
ingenious. The often clapping and folding of the
hands note covetousness; and their much moving
in speech, loquacity. Short and fat fingers mark a
man out as intemperate and silly; but long and
lean, as witty. If his fingers crook upward, that
shows him liberal; if downward, niggardly. Long
nails and crooked signify one to be brutish, ravenous,
and unchaste; very short nails, pale and sharp, show
him subtle and beguiling." Among other omens, we
are told that the itching of the right hand signifies
that it will shortly receive money, whereas if the left
hand be the one to itch, it is a sign that money will
before very many days have to be paid away. In
Suffolk the peasants have the following rhyme on the
subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If your hand itches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're going to take riches;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rub it on wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure to come good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rub it on iron,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure to come flying;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Rub it on brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure to come to pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rub it on steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure to come a deal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rub it on tin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure to come agin."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A moist hand is said to denote an amorous constitution,
and in <cite>2 Henry IV.</cite> (Act i., sc. 2), the Lord
Chief Justice enumerates a dry hand among the
characteristics of age and debility.</p>

<p>Palmistry, or divination by means of the hands, a
species of fortune-telling still much practised, we have
already described in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">another chapter</a>. A superstition,
however, which we must not omit to mention, is the
practice of rubbing with a dead hand for the purpose
of taking away disease, instances of which, even now-a-days,
are of occasional occurrence. Mr. Henderson
mentions a case that happened about the year 1853.
The wife of a pitman at Castle Eden Colliery, who
was suffering from a wen in the neck, went alone,
according to advice given her by a "wise woman,"
and lay all night in the out-house, with the hand of a
corpse on her wen. She had been assured that the
hand of a suicide was an infallible cure. The shock,
at any rate, to her nervous system from that terrible
night was so great that she did not rally for some
months, and eventually she died from the wen.
As a further specimen of this incredible superstition,
we may quote the following case, which
happened some years ago in an Eastern county. A
little girl of about eight years of age had from birth
been troubled with scrofulous disease, and had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
reared with great difficulty. Her friends consulted
the "wise man" of the neighbourhood, who told
the mother that if she took the girl and rubbed her
naked body all over with the hand of a dead man she
would be cured. The experiment was tried, and the
poor little girl was nearly killed with fright, and, of
course, made no progress whatever towards health.</p>

<p>Many of our readers are, no doubt, acquainted
with the famous "dead man's hand," which was
formerly kept at Bryn Hall, in Lancashire. It is
said to have been the hand of Father Arrowsmith, a
priest who, according to some accounts, was put to
death for his religion in the time of William III.
Preserved with great care in a white silken bag, this
hand was resorted to by many diseased persons, and
wonderful cures are reported to have been effected by
this saintly relic. Thus, we are told of a woman who,
afflicted with the small-pox, had this dead hand in
bed with her every night for six weeks; and of a poor
lad who was rubbed with it for the cure of scrofulous
sores. It is, indeed, generally supposed that practices
of this kind are rare and of exceptional occurrence,
but they are far more common than might be imagined,
although not recorded in newspapers. This is, however,
in a great measure owing to the fact that those who
believe in and have recourse to such rites observe
secresy, for fear of meeting with ridicule from others.</p>

<p>The nails, also, as we have mentioned in our
<a href="#CHAPTER_II">chapter on Childhood</a>, have their folk-lore, the little
specks which are seen on them being regarded as
ominous. Many have their particular days for cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the nails. Of the numerous rhymes on the
subject, we may quote the following as a specimen,
from which it will be seen that every day has its
peculiar virtue:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Cut them on Monday, you cut them for health;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut them on Tuesday, you cut them for wealth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut them on Wednesday, you cut them for news;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut them on Thursday, a new pair of shoes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut them on Friday, you cut them for sorrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut them on Saturday, see your true love to-morrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut them on Sunday, the devil will be with you all the week."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This old rhyming-saw differs in various localities,
although in the main points it is the same; as by
general consent both Friday and Sunday are regarded
as most inauspicious days for cutting both the nails
and hair.</p>

<p>Once more, to sit cross-legged is said to produce
good fortune; and occasionally at a card-table one
may find some superstitiously-inclined person sitting
in this attitude with a view of securing good luck.
Sir Thomas Browne, on the contrary, tells us that in
days gone to "sit cross-legged, or with the fingers
pectinated" or shut together, was accounted a sign of
bad luck: a superstition alluded to by Pliny.
Referring to the feet, we cannot do more than just
allude to two or three items of folk-lore with which
they are connected. Thus, a flat-footed person is
generally considered to have a bad temper, a notion
indeed which daily experience often proves to be
incorrect. The itching of the foot has been supposed
to indicate that its owner will shortly undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a strange journey; while that unpleasant sensation
popularly styled "the foot going to sleep," is often
charmed away by crossing the foot with saliva.
When the division between the toes is incomplete, and
they are partially joined, they are called "twin
toes," and are said to bring good luck. This section
of our "Domestic Folk-lore" might have been prolonged
to an almost indefinite extent had space permitted,
but as the preceding pages amply bear witness
to the prevalence of such ideas, we will proceed
to discuss another, and, it is to be hoped, not less
interesting class of superstitions.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<small>ARTICLES OF DRESS.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">New Clothes at Easter and Whitsuntide&mdash;Wearing of Clothes&mdash;The
Clothes of the Dead&mdash;The Apron, Stockings, Garters, &amp;c.&mdash;The
Shoe&mdash;The Glove&mdash;The Ring&mdash;Pins.</p></blockquote>


<p>One would scarcely expect to find a host of odd
fancies attached to such matter-of-fact necessities as
articles of dress, but yet they hold a prominent place in
our domestic folk-lore. However trivial at first sight
these may seem, they are nevertheless interesting, in
so far as they illustrate certain features of our social
history, and show from another point of view how
superstition is interwoven with all that appertains to
human life. Beginning, then, with a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
piece of folk-lore, most persons wear new clothes on
Easter-Day, mindful of the old admonition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"At Easter let your clothes be new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else be sure you will it rue"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&mdash;a notion that still retains its hold on the popular
mind, few being found bold enough to transgress this
long-rooted custom. In the North of England, so
strong is the feeling on this point, that young people
rarely omit visiting the nearest market-town prior to
Eastertide, to buy some new article of dress or
personal ornament, as otherwise they believe the birds&mdash;notably
rooks&mdash;will spoil their clothes. A similar
fancy prevails with regard to Whitsuntide, and many
would consider that they had forfeited their good
luck for the next twelve months if they did not
appear in "new things" on Whitsunday.</p>

<p>The superstitions relating to clothes are very
numerous, varying in different localities. Thus,
according to a Suffolk notion, "if you have your
clothes mended on your back, you will be ill-spoken
of," or as they say in Sussex, "you will come to
want." Again, many before putting on a new coat or
dress, take care to place some money in the right-hand
pocket, as this insures its always being full. If by
mistake, however, the money is put in the left-hand
pocket, then the person will never have a penny so
long as the coat lasts. It is also a very prevalent
belief that if one would secure luck with any article
of dress, it must be worn for the first time at church.
Equal attention, too, is paid by many to the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
they put on each article of dress&mdash;as, in case of its
being accidentally inside out, it is considered an omen
of success. It is necessary, however, if one wishes
the omen to hold good, to wear the reversed portion
of attire with the wrong side out till the regular time
comes for taking it off. If reversed earlier, the luck
is immediately lost. The idea of the "hind-side
before" is so closely related to that of "inside out,"
that one can hardly understand their being taken
for contrary omens; yet, "It is worthy of remark,
in connection with this superstition," says a correspondent
of Chambers's "Book of Days," "that when
William the Conqueror, in arming himself for the
battle of Hastings, happened to put on his shirt of
mail with the hind-side before, the bystanders seem to
have been shocked by it, as by an ill-omen, till
William claimed it as a good one, betokening that
he was to be changed from a duke to a king."
Another piece of superstition tells us that the clothes
of the dead never last very long, but that as the body
decays, so in the same degree do the garments and
linen which belonged to the deceased. Hence, in
Essex there is a popular saying to the effect that "the
clothes of the dead always wear full of holes." When
therefore a person dies, and the relatives, it may be,
give away the clothes to the poor, one may frequently
hear a remark of this kind, "Ah, they may look very
well, but they won't wear; they belong to the dead."
A similar belief prevails in Denmark, where a corpse
is not allowed to be buried in the clothes of a living
person, lest as the clothes rot in the grave, that person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to whom they belonged should waste away and perish.
In accordance also with a superstition prevalent in
the Netherlands, the rings of a dead friend or relative
are never given away, as it is a sure sign that the
giver too will soon die. An absurd notion exists in
many parts&mdash;one much credited by our country
peasantry&mdash;that if a mother gives away all the baby's
clothes in her possession, she will be sure to have
another addition to her family, although the event
may be contrary to all expectation. Among other
items of folk-lore associated with clothes, we may
mention that in the North of England to put a
button or hook into the wrong hole while one is
dressing in the morning, is held to be a warning that
some misfortune will happen in the course of the day;
and in Northamptonshire it is said that servants who
go to their places in black will never stay the year
out. A Dorsetshire superstition is that if a gentleman
accidentally burns the tail of his coat, or a lady
the hem of her skirt, during a visit at a friend's
house, it is a proof they will repeat their visit.</p>

<p>Another article of dress that has its superstitions
is the apron, which some women turn before the new
moon, to insure good luck for the ensuing month. In
Yorkshire, when a married woman's apron falls off, it
is a sign that something is coming to vex her; when,
however, the apron of an unmarried girl drops down,
she is frequently the object of laughter, as there is
considered no surer sign than that she is thinking
about her sweetheart. Again, if a young woman's
petticoats are longer than her dress, this is a proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that her mother does not love her so much as her
father, a notion which extends as far as Scotland.
This piece of folk-lore may have originated in the
mother not attending so much to the child's dress
as was her duty, whereas, however much the father
may love his child, he may at the same time be
perfectly ignorant of the rights and wrongs of female
attire: an excuse which does not hold good in
the case of the mother. Some of the descriptions
of plants in use among the rural peasantry refer to
the petticoat. Thus, the poppy is said to have a red
petticoat and a green gown; the daffodil, a yellow
petticoat and green gown, and so on; these fancies
being the subject of many of our old nursery rhymes,
as, for instance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Daffadown-dilly is come up to town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a yellow petticoat and a green gown."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Passing on in the next place to stockings, it is
lucky, as with other articles of dress, to put one
wrong-side out, but unlucky to turn it on discovering
one's mistake. Some, too, consider it a matter of
importance as to which foot they put the stocking
on first when dressing themselves in the morning&mdash;the
luck of the day being supposed in a great
measure to depend on this circumstance&mdash;as to
clothe the left foot before the right one is a sign of
misfortune. "Flinging the stocking" was an old
marriage custom, being really a kind of divination,
which Misson, in his "Travels through England,"
thus describes:&mdash;"The young men, it seems, took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
bride's stockings, and the girls those of the bridegroom,
each of whom, sitting at the foot of the bed,
threw the stocking over their heads, endeavouring to
make it fall upon that of the bride or her spouse;
if the bridegroom's stocking, thrown by the girls,
fell upon the bridegroom's head, it was a sign that
they themselves would soon be married; and similar
luck was derived from the falling of the bride's
stockings, thrown by the young men."</p>

<p>There is a superstitious notion in some places that
when the bride retires to rest on her wedding-night,
her bridesmaids should lay her stockings across, as
this act is supposed to guarantee her future prosperity
in the marriage state. Another use to which the
stocking has been put is its being hung up to receive
presents at Christmas-time, a custom which, as Mr.
Henderson points out, the Pilgrim Fathers carried to
America, and bequeathed to their descendants.</p>

<p>It is curious to find even the garter an object of
superstition, being employed by young women in their
love divinations on Midsummer Eve, a period, it must
be remembered, considered most propitious for such
ceremonies. Their mode of procedure is this:&mdash;The
maiden anxious to have a peep of her future husband
must sleep in a county different from that in which
she usually resides, and on going to bed must take
care to knit the left garter about the right stocking,
repeating the following incantation, and at every
pause knitting a knot:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"This knot I knit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know the thing I know not yet;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<span class="i4">That I may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man that shall my husband be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he goes, and what he wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what he does all days and years."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On retiring to rest the wished-for one will appear
in her dreams, wearing the insignia of his trade or
profession.</p>

<p>Again, as a popular object of superstition the
shoe is unrivalled, and antiquaries are still undecided
as to why our forefathers invested this matter-of-fact
article of dress with such mysterious qualities, selecting
it as the symbol of good fortune, one of the well-known
uses in which it has been employed being the
throwing of it for luck, constant allusions to which
practice occur in our old writers. Thus, Beaumont
and Fletcher, in <cite>The Honest Man's Fortune</cite>, refer
to it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Captain, your shoes are old; pray put 'em off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let one fling 'em after us."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Ben Jonson, in his <cite>Masque of the Gipsies</cite>, represents
one of the gipsies as saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Hurle after an old shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll be merry what e'er I doe."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This custom, which was once so prevalent, has not yet
died out, for in Norfolk, whenever servants are going
after new situations, a shoe is thrown after them,
with the wish that they may succeed in what they are
going about. Some years ago, when vessels engaged
in the Greenland whale fishery left Whitby, in Yorkshire,
the wives and friends of the sailors threw old
shoes at the ships as they passed the pier-head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Indeed, this practice is frequently observed in towns
on the sea-coast, and a correspondent of <cite>Notes and
Queries</cite> informs us that one day, when at Swansea,
he received a shoe on his shoulder which was intended
for a young sailor leaving his home to embark upon a
trading voyage. Tennyson has not omitted to speak
of this piece of superstition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"For this thou shalt from all things seek<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Marrow of mirth and laughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wheresoe'er thou move, good luck<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Shall throw her old shoe after."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As an emblem of good luck, the shoe is thrown with
much enthusiasm after a bridal couple. Various explanations
have been given of this popular custom.
Some think that it was originally intended as a sham
assault on the bridegroom for carrying off the bride;
and hence a survival of the old ceremony of opposition
to the capture of a bride. Others again are of
opinion that the shoe was in former times a symbol of
the exercise of dominion and authority over her by
her father or guardian; the receipt of the shoe by the
bridegroom, even if accidental, being an omen that the
authority was transferred to him. Thus, in the Bible,
the receiving of a shoe was an evidence and symbol of
asserting or accepting dominion or ownership; whereas
the giving back of the shoe was the symbol of resigning
it. Another reason for throwing the shoe is given
in the following old rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"When Britons bold<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wedded of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sandals were backward thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<span class="i4">The pair to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That, ill or well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The act was all their own."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Throwing the shoe after the wedded pair was, also,
no doubt intended as an augury of long life to
the bride. In Yorkshire the ceremony of shoe-throwing
is termed "thrashing," and the older the shoe
the greater the luck; and in some parts of Kent the
mode of procedure is somewhat peculiar. After the
departure of the bride and bridegroom the single
ladies are drawn up in one row, and the bachelors
in another. When thus arranged, an old shoe is
thrown as far as possible, which the fair sex run for:
the winner being considered to have the best chance
of marriage. She then throws the shoe at the gentlemen,
when the first who gets it is believed to have
the same chance of matrimony. A somewhat similar
custom prevails in Germany, where the bride's shoe
is thrown among the guests at the wedding, the person
who succeeds in catching it being supposed to have
every prospect of a speedy marriage.</p>

<p>Many auguries are still gathered from the shoe.
Thus young girls on going to bed at night place their
shoes at right angles to one another, in the form of
the letter T, repeating this rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Hoping this night my true love to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I place my shoes in the form of a T."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As in the case of the stocking, great importance is
attached by many superstitious persons as to which
shoe they put on first, in allusion to which Butler, in
his "Hudibras," says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Augustus, having b' oversight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put on his left shoe 'fore his right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had like to have been slain that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By soldiers mutin'ing for pay."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>An old writer speaking of Jewish customs tells us
that "some of them observe, in dressing themselves
in the morning, to put on the right stocking and right
shoe first without tying it. Then afterwards to put
on the left shoe, and so return to the right; that
so they may begin and end with the right one,
which they account to be the most fortunate." A
Suffolk doggrel respecting the "wear of shoes" teaches
us the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Tip at the toe: live to see woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear at the side: live to be a bride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear at the ball: live to spend all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear at the heel: live to save a deal."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among some of the many charms in which the shoe
has been found efficacious, may be mentioned one
practised in the North of England, where the peasantry,
to cure cramp, are in the habit of laying their shoes
across to avert it. Mrs. Latham, in her "West Sussex
Superstitions," published in the "Folk-lore Record,"
tells us of an old woman who was at a complete
loss to understand why her "rheumatics was so uncommon
bad, for she had put her shoes in the form
of a cross every night by the side of her head, ever
since she felt the first twinge." In the same county,
a cure for ague consists in wearing a leaf of tansy in
the shoe.</p>

<p>It is curious that the shoe should have entered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the superstitions associated with death. According to
an Aryan tradition, the greater part of the way from
the land of the living to that of death lay through
morasses, and vast moors overgrown with furze and
thorns. That the dead might not pass over them
barefoot, a pair of shoes was laid with them in the
grave. Hence a funeral is still called in the Henneberg
district "dead-shoe," and in Scandinavia the shoe
itself is known as "hel-shoe." There are countless
other items of folk-lore connected with the shoe:
thus in days gone by the phrase, "Over shoes, over
boots" was equivalent to the popular phrase, "In for

in Taylor's "Workes" (1630):&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">The proverb says, once over shoes, o'er boots."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Again, "to stand in another man's shoe" is a popular
expression for occupying the place or laying claim to
the honours of another. "Looking for dead men's
shoes" is still an every-day phrase denoting those who
are continually expecting some advantage which will
accrue to them on the death of another. The shoe-horn,
too, from its convenient use in drawing on a
tight shoe, was formerly applied in a jocular metaphor
to subservient and tractable assistants. Thus,
for instance, Shakespeare in <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite>
(Act v., sc. 1) makes Thersites in his railing mood
give this name to Menelaus, whom he calls "a thrifty
shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's
(Agamemnon's) leg." It was also employed as a
contemptuous phrase for danglers after young women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>A further article of dress that has had much
honour conferred upon it is the glove, holding as it
does a conspicuous place in many of our old customs
and ceremonies. Thus in days gone by it was given,
by way of delivery or investiture, in sales or conveyances
of lands and goods. It was also employed
as the token of a challenge to fight, a symbolical
staking, perhaps of the prowess of the hand to which
the glove belonged. Hence to hang up a glove in
church was a public challenge, very much as a notice
affixed to a church-door is a public notice. <i>Apropos</i>
of this custom, a story is given in the life of the Rev.
Bernard Gilpin, of the diocese of Durham, who died
in 1583. It appears that he observed a glove hanging
high up in his church, and ascertaining that it was
designed as a challenge to any one who should dare to
displace it, he desired his sexton to do so. "Not I,
sir, I dare do no such thing," he replied. Whereupon
the parson called for a long staff, and taking it down
himself, put it in his pocket. Preaching afterwards
on the subject, he denounced this unseemly practice,
saying, "Behold, I have taken it down myself," and
producing the glove, he exhibited it to the whole
congregation as a spectacle of honour. This custom,
we are told, does not appear to have been much
older in this country than the thirteenth century, for
Matthew Paris, in writing of the year 1245, speaks
of it expressly as French. Noblemen wore their ladies'
gloves in front of their hats, a practice mentioned by
Drayton as having been in vogue at the battle of
Agincourt:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The noble youth, the common rank above,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And each one took it on his happy speed,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The gift of a pair of gloves was at one time the
ordinary perquisite of those who performed some small
service; and in process of time, to make the reward
of greater value, the glove was "lined" with money;
hence the term "glove-money." Relics of the old
custom still survive in the presentation of gloves to
those who attend weddings and funerals. It is
difficult, however, to discover the connection between
gloves and a stolen kiss. Our readers, for example,
may recollect how, in Sir Walter Scott's "Fair Maid
of Perth," Catharine steals from her chamber on
St. Valentine's morn, and catching Henry Smith
asleep, gives him a kiss; then we have the following:&mdash;"Come
into the booth with me, my son, and I
will furnish thee with a fitting theme. Thou knowest
the maiden who ventures to kiss a sleeping man, wins
of him a pair of gloves." Gloves are still given to
a judge at a maiden assize, a custom which, it has
been suggested, originated in a Saxon law, which
forbade the judges to wear gloves while sitting on the
Bench. Hence, to give a pair of gloves to a judge
was tantamount to saying that he need not trouble
to come to the Bench, but might wear gloves. Again,
in bygone times gloves were worn as a mark of
distinction by sovereigns, ecclesiastical dignitaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and others; their workmanship being excessively
costly, richly embroidered as they were and decorated
with jewels. "The association of gloves with
ecclesiastical dignity survived," says Mr. Leadam
in the <cite>Antiquary</cite>, "the Reformation in England;
for although they ceased to be worn in the services
of the Church, yet as late as the reign of
Charles II. bishops upon their consecration were
accustomed to present gloves to the archbishop, and
to all who came to their consecration banquet. The
lavender gloves with golden fringes which do often
adorn their portraits, may still remind our modern
prelates of the ancient glories of their predecessors."
It was also customary to hang a pair of white gloves
on the pews of unmarried villagers who had died in
the flower of their youth, and at several towns in
England it has been customary from time immemorial
to announce a fair by hoisting a huge glove upon a
pole&mdash;a practice which exists at Macclesfield, Portsmouth,
Southampton, and Chester; the glove being
taken down at the conclusion of the fair. Hone,
in his description of Exeter Lammas Fair, says:&mdash;"The
charter for this fair is perpetuated by a glove
of immense size, stuffed and carried through the city
on a very long pole, decorated with ribbons, flowers, &amp;c.,
and attended with music, parish beadles, and the nobility.
It is afterwards placed on the top of the Guildhall,
and then the fair commences; on the taking
down of the glove the fair terminates." Mr. Leadam
also quotes a passage from the "Speculum Saxonicum"
which throws light on the origin of this custom:&mdash;"No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
one is allowed to set up a market or a mint,
without the consent of the ordinary or judge of that
place; the king ought also to send a glove as a sign
of his consent to the same." The glove, therefore,
was the king's glove, the earliest form of royal charter,
the original sign-manual. Among other items of folk-lore
connected with this useful article of dress, we may
mention that the term "right as my glove" is a phrase,
according to Sir Walter Scott, derived from the practice
of pledging the glove as the sign of irrefragable
faith. Gloves, too, were in olden times fashionable new
year's gifts, having been far more expensive than now-a-days.
When Sir Thomas More was Lord Chancellor,
he happened to determine a case in favour of a lady
named Croaker, who, as a mark of her gratitude,
sent him a new year's gift in the shape of a pair
of gloves with forty angels in them. But Sir Thomas
returned the money with the following letter:&mdash;"Mistress,
since it were against good manners to
refuse your new year's gift, I am content to take
your gloves, but as for the lining I utterly refuse
it." In the time of Queen Elizabeth, the rural bridegroom
wore gloves in his hat as a sign of good
husbandry; and on the "Border" to bite the glove
was considered a pledge of deadly vengeance, in allusion
to which Sir Walter Scott, in his "Lay of the
Last Minstrel," says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Stern Rutherford right little said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bit his glove and shook his head."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The ring, apart from its eventful history, has from
the most remote period been surrounded, both in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and other countries, not only with a most extensive
legendary lore, but with a vast array of superstitions,
a detailed account of which would be impossible in a
small volume like the present one; so we must confine
ourselves to some of the most popular.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, certain mysterious virtues
have been supposed to reside in rings, not so much
on account of their shape as from the materials of
which they have been composed. Thus, they have
been much worn as talismans or charms, being thought
to be infallible preservatives against unseen dangers of
every kind. Referring to some of these, we find, for
instance, that the turquoise ring was believed to
possess special properties, a superstition to which Dr.
Donne alludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"A compassionate turquoise, that doth tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By looking pale, the wearer is not well."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Fenton, too, in his "Secret Wonders of Nature,"
describes the stone:&mdash;"The turkeys doth move when
there is any peril prepared to him that weareth it."
The turquoise ring of Shylock, which, we are told in
the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite> (Act iii., sc. 1), he would not
part with for a "wilderness of monkeys," was, no
doubt, valued for its secret virtues.</p>

<p>The carbuncle, again, amongst other properties, was
said to give out a natural light, to which it has been
supposed Shakespeare alludes in <cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>
(Act ii., sc. 3), where, speaking of the ring on the finger
of Bassianus, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Upon his bloody finger he doth wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which, like a taper in some monument,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shows the ragged entrails of the pit."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A piece of popular superstition makes it unlucky
to wear an opal ring, although this lovely stone has
always been an object of peculiar admiration from the
beautiful variety of colours which it displays, and in the
Middle Ages was even thought to possess the united
virtues of all the gems with whose distinctive colours
it was emblazoned. The diamond was believed to counteract
poison, a notion which prevailed to a comparatively
late period; though, according to another belief,
it was considered the most dangerous of poisons, and as
such we find it enumerated among the poisons administered
to Sir Thomas Overbury, when a prisoner in
the Tower. An emerald ring was thought to insure
purity of thought; and a toadstone ring was worn as
an amulet to preserve new-born children and their
mothers from fairies.</p>

<p>Among the omens associated with rings, we may
briefly note that to lose a ring which has been given
as a pledge of affection is unlucky; as also is the
breaking of a ring on the finger; while further superstitions
relating to the wedding-ring have been noticed
at length in our <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">chapter on marriage</a>. In days
gone by, too, "medicated rings" were held in great
repute, and were much used for the cure of diseases,
instances of which we find among the remedies still
in use for cramp, epilepsy, and fits. Silver seems to
have been considered highly efficacious; and rings
made of lead, mixed with quicksilver, were worn as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
charms against headaches and other complaints.
Dactylomancy, or divination by rings, is not quite
forgotten among eager aspirants after matrimony, one
mode being to suspend a ring by a thread or hair
within a glass tumbler, notice being taken as to how
many times it strikes the sides of the glass without
being touched. Once more, there is an old piece of folk-lore
on the colours of stones in "keepsake rings":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Oh, green is forsaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yellow is forsworn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But blue is the prettiest colour that's worn."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Passing from the ring to another article of dress&mdash;perhaps
the most insignificant&mdash;namely, the pin, we
nevertheless find it invested with all kinds of curious
superstitions. Thus, it is said that on seeing a pin,
one should always pick it up for the sake of good
luck, as those who omit to do so run into imminent
danger of being overtaken by misfortune, a notion
embodied in the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"See a pin and pick it up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the day you'll have good luck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See a pin and let it lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the day you'll have to cry."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Why, however, North-country people are so persistent
in their refusal to give one another a pin, it is
not easy to discover. When asked for a pin, they
invariably reply, "You may take one; but, mind, I do
not give it." One of the most popular species of
enchantment to which pins have been applied is that
sometimes employed in counteracting the evil effects
of witchcraft. One mode is by "pin-sticking," a case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of which recently occurred in the parish of Honiton
Clyst, in Devonshire. A landlord having lost one of his
tenants, certain repairs and improvements were found
necessary to prepare for the next. In carrying out
the work a chimney had to be explored, when, in
the course of the operation, there was found carefully
secreted a pig's heart stuck all over with thin prickles,
evidently a substitute for pins. This is supposed to
have been done by the direction of some "wise" or
cunning person, as a means of taking revenge on the
witch to whose incantations the party considered some
mischief due, in the belief that the heart of the ill-wisher
would be pierced in like manner, until it
eventually became as pulseless as that of the pig.</p>

<p>It appears, too, that pins were largely used in a
particular species of sorcery. Whenever, for instance,
some malevolent individual wished to carry out her
ill-natured designs, she made a clay image of the
person she intended to harm, baptised the said image
with the name of the party whom it was meant to
represent, and stuck it full of pins or burnt it.
Where the pins were placed the person whom it represented
was afflicted with pain, and as the figure
wasted, so he was said to waste away. Shakespeare
alludes to this superstition, and in <cite>Richard III.</cite> (Act
iii., sc. 4) makes the Duke of Gloucester say to
Hastings:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Then be your eyes the witness of this ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, like a blasted sapling, withered up!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That by their witchcraft thus have marked me."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Pins, too, have been in extensive demand for
divination, and here and there throughout the
country we find "wishing wells," into which if the
passers-by only drop a crooked pin and breathe their
wish, it is said they may rest assured of its fulfilment
at some future date.</p>

<p>So much, then, for our illustrations of the folk-lore
of dress, a subject which, interesting though it is, we
have now discussed at sufficient length.</p>

<small>TABLE SUPERSTITIONS.</small></h2>
<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Thirteen at Table&mdash;Salt-spilling&mdash;The Knife&mdash;Bread, and other
Articles of Food&mdash;Wishing Bones&mdash;Tea-leaves&mdash;Singing before
Breakfast&mdash;Shaking Hands across the Table.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is frequently found that even strong-minded persons
are not exempt from the prejudice against sitting
down to dinner when there are only thirteen present.
Many amusing anecdotes are recorded of the devices
resorted to for avoiding the consequences supposed
to be incurred by the neglect of this superstition&mdash;the
notion being that one of the thirteen, generally
the youngest, will die within the next twelve months.
To avoid, therefore, any such contingency, many
persons, should they be disappointed in one of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
guests, have the empty place filled by a child, and
should one not always be forthcoming, no slight inconvenience
is occasionally produced. Not very long ago
a case was recorded in which a lady, not being able at
the last moment to make up the number fourteen, had
her favourite cat seated at the table, hoping thereby
to break the fatal spell attaching to the unlucky
number thirteen.</p>

<p>The origin popularly assigned to this widespread
superstition is the fact that thirteen was the number
at the Last Supper, Judas being the thirteenth. A
correspondent of the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, however,
writing at the close of the last century, says that it is
"founded on the calculations adhered to by the
insurance offices, which presume that out of thirteen
persons, taken indiscriminately, one will die within
a year." But this is not the probable origin, that
which connects it with the Last Supper being no
doubt the correct one. Some, says Lord Lyttelton, in
<cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, have carried the superstition "to
the extent of disliking the number thirteen at all
times; but the commoner form limits it to Friday&mdash;not
that there is any ground for fact in this, for the
Last Supper was on the fifth, not the sixth day of
the week. Sailors are held somewhat superstitious,
and I knew an eminent naval officer who actually
would walk out of the room when the conjunction
happened on a Friday, after the death of the wife and
eldest daughter, both of which events were preceded
by the said conjunction." Among other instances of
this piece of superstition, we may quote the following,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
related by Addison in the <cite>Spectator</cite>:&mdash;"I remember,"
he says, "I was one in a mixed assembly that was
full of wine and mirth, when on a sudden an old
woman unluckily observed that there were thirteen of
us in company. This remark struck a panic terror
into several who were present, insomuch that one or
two of the ladies were going to leave the room; but
a friend of mine, taking notice that one of our female
companions was likely to become a mother, affirmed
there were fourteen in the room, and that instead
of portending that one in the company should die,
it plainly foretold that one of them should be born.
Had not my friend found this expedient to break the
omen, I question not but half the women in the company
should have fallen sick that very night." Again,
we may give another anecdote recorded by Rachel, the
celebrated <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tragédienne</i>. On her return from Egypt,
in the spring of 1857, she installed herself in a villa
in the neighbourhood of Montpellier. There she received
a visit from the poet Ponsard and Arséne
Houssaye, the latter of whom was making a tour as
inspector of the Departmental Museums. "Do you
recollect the dinner we had at the house of Victor
Hugo, at the close of the repetition of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Angelo</i>?" she
said to the former. "You remember there were <em>thirteen</em>
of us. There was Hugo and his wife, you and your
wife, Rebecca and I, Girardin and his wife, and some
others. Well! where to-day are the thirteen? Victor
Hugo and his wife are in Jersey; your wife is dead;
Madame de Girardin is dead; my poor Rebecca is
dead; Gerard de Nerval, Oradie, Alfred de Musset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
are dead. I&mdash;say no more. There remain but
Girardin and you. Adieu! my friends. Never laugh
at thirteen at a table!" Anecdotes, indeed, relating
to this superstition are without number, and form
many an amusing episode in the lives of noted characters.
It may be mentioned here that the number
thirteen is considered ominous in other ways. Fuller,
by way of example, tells us how a covetous courtier
complained to King Edward VI. that Christ College,
Cambridge, was a superstitious foundation, consisting
of a master and twelve fellows, in imitation of
Christ and His twelve Apostles. He, therefore, advised
the king to take away one or two fellowships,
so as to dissolve that unlucky number. "Oh, no,"
replied the king, "I have a better way than that
to mar their conceit; I will add a thirteenth fellowship
to them," which he accordingly did.</p>

<p>Another equally popular superstition is the ill-luck
supposed to attach to salt-spilling: one notion being
that to upset the salt-cellar while in the act of handing
it to any one is a sign of an impending quarrel
between the parties. It is also said to indicate sorrow
or trouble to the person spilling it, and to counteract
the evil consequences of this unlucky act one should
fling some salt over the shoulder. Gay speaks of this
popular fancy in the fable of the "Farmer's Wife
and the Raven":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The salt was spilt, to me it fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to contribute to my loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My knife and fork were laid across."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Indeed constant allusions are found to this widespread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
superstition both in our old and modern
writers. Gayton, describing two friends, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"I have two friends of either sex, which do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eat little salt, or none, yet are friends too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of both which persons I can truly tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are of patience most invincible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom out of temper no mischance at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can put&mdash;no, if towards them the salt should fall."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This piece of folk-lore dates back up to the time
of the Romans, and at the present day is not limited
to our own country. It has been suggested that it
may have originated from the circumstance that salt
was formerly used in sacrifices, and that to spill it
when once placed on the head of the victim was
regarded as a bad omen. Bailey, however, assigns
a very different reason, telling us that salt was
considered by the ancients incorruptible, and on this
account was made the symbol of friendship. If it,
therefore, was spilt, the persons between whom it
happened thought their friendship would not be of
long duration.</p>

<p>Some people dislike even so much as to put salt
on another person's plate, considering this act
equivalent to wishing one's neighbour misfortune.
Hence there is a well-known couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Help me to salt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help me to sorrow."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A correspondent of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> relates how
one day he offered to help an old Highland lady at
dinner to some salt from the cellar, which stood much
nearer to him than to her; when she gravely put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
back his hand, and drew away her plate, saying at
the same time, with a kind of shudder, between her
teeth, "Help me to salt, help me to sorrow." The
ill-luck may be averted by a second help. Salt has
also been considered a powerful safeguard against
evil spirits; and in Scotland it was once customary in
brewing to throw a handful of salt on the top of the
mash to ward off witches. Again, as an interesting
illustration of the change which has passed over our
domestic manners, we may quote the phrase "to sit
above the salt," that is, in a place of honour, whereby
a marked and invidious distinction was formerly
maintained among those at the same table. A large
salt-cellar was usually placed about the middle of a
long table, the places above which were assigned to
the guests of distinction, those below to inferiors and
poor relations. It argues little for the delicacy of our
ancestors that they should have permitted such
ill-natured distinctions at their board; often, as it has
been said, placing their guests "below the salt" for
no better purpose than that of mortifying them.
Hence Ben Jonson, speaking of the characteristics of
an insolent coxcomb, says:&mdash;"His fashion is not to
take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes.
He never drinks below the salt."</p>

<p>Among the many other odd items of folk-lore
associated with the table, we may mention in the
next place those relating to the knife. Thus, to let a
knife drop is a sign that a visitor is coming to the
house; and to lay the knife and fork crosswise on
one's plate is an omen that crosses and troubles will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
soon occur. Equally unlucky, too, is it to give any
kind of knife away, for, as Gay in his "Shepherd's
Week" says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"But woe is me! such presents luckless prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For knives, they tell me, always sever love."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Indeed, this superstition is not confined to a knife,
but extends to any sharp or cutting instrument, such
as a pair of scissors, a razor, &amp;c. To avoid the
danger of such a misfortune, some trifling recompense
must be made in return. This superstition was confuted
by a versifier of the last century&mdash;the Rev.
Samuel Bishop&mdash;who presented a knife to his wife on
her fifteenth wedding-day, with a copy of some very
clever verses of which the following are a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"A knife, dear girl, cuts love, they say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mere modish love perhaps it may;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For any tool of any kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can separate what was never joined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The knife that cuts our love in two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will have much tougher work to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must cut your softness, worth, and spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the vulgar size of merit," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some consider it unlucky to find a knife, from a
notion that it will bring ill-luck to them; while
others again often place a knife near a sleeping child
as a charm to preserve it from danger, a belief to
which Herrick thus refers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Let the superstitious wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the child's heart lay a knife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Point be up, and haft be down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While she gossips in the town.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This 'mongst other mystic charms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps the sleeping child from harms."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even the loaf of bread, too, without which the most
frugal board would be incomplete, has not escaped
without its quota of folk-lore. Thus, many a housewife
still marks the sign of the cross upon her loaf
before placing it in the oven, just as the Durham
butcher does to the shoulder of a sheep or lamb after
taking off the skin&mdash;the notion probably being to
protect it against the injurious influence of witchcraft.
In many parts of Scotland peasants were formerly in
the habit of making a cross on their tools, considering
that by so doing they would be rendered safe against
the mischievous pranks of the fairy folks as they
went on their midnight errands. Again, if a loaf
accidentally parts in the hand while an unmarried
lady is cutting it, this either prognosticates that she
will not be married during the next twelve months,
or, what is still worse, that there will be a dissension
of some kind in the family. Some, too, have a superstitious
objection to turning a loaf upside-down after
cutting it. Herrick refers to the custom of carrying
a crust of bread in the pocket for luck's sake&mdash;a
practice which is not quite obsolete:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If ye fear to be affrighted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ye are, by chance, benighted;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In your pocket for a trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carry nothing but a crust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that holy piece of bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charms the danger and the dread."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>While speaking of bread it may not be inappropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to refer to a few other articles of fare around
which superstition has cast its mantle. Thus, eggs
have an extensive folk-lore both in this and other
countries. Many persons, for instance, after eating
an egg take special care to crush the shell; the
omission of this ceremony, as they fancy, being
attended with ill-luck. Sir Thomas Browne informs
us that the real reason is to prevent witchcraft:
"lest witches should draw or prick their names
therein, and veneficiously mischief their person,
they broke the shell." It is also considered a bad
omen to bring eggs into the house after dark,
and many persons avoid burning egg-shells lest the
hens should cease to lay. According to a superstition
current in the West of England, one should always
make a hole through an egg-shell before throwing it
away, as, unless this is done, there is a danger of
witches using them to put to sea for the purpose
of wrecking ships. Beaumont and Fletcher in their
"Women Pleased" allude to this notion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The devil should think of purchasing that egg-shell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To victual out a witch for the Burmoothies."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Just as it is considered, too, unlucky to bring eggs
into the house after dark, so the same prejudice exists
with regard to taking them out. One day, we are
told in the <cite>Stamford Mercury</cite> (Oct. 29, 1852), a
person in want of some eggs called at a farmhouse
and inquired of the good woman whether she had
any eggs to sell, to which she replied that she had a
few scores to dispose of. "Then I'll take them home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
with me in the cart," was his answer, to which
she somewhat indignantly replied, "That you will
not; don't you know the sun has gone down?
You are welcome to the eggs at a proper hour
of the day, but I would not let them go out of the
house after the sun is set on any consideration
whatever." A Norfolk superstition warns persons
against eating the marrow of pork lest they should
go mad; and, in the North of England, we are
told that should the meat for dinner shrink in the
pot, it presages a downfall in life. Should it swell,
on the contrary, to a large size, it denotes that the
head of the family will be prosperous in his undertakings.
These odd fancies vary in different localities,
and in out-of-the-way districts where the railway
has not yet penetrated, they still retain their hold on
the primitive and uncultivated minds of our agricultural
peasantry. At the same time, however, occasional
survivals of many of these old worn-out
superstitions crop up in unexpected quarters, showing
they are not completely dead. Thus, our children
still practise their divination by means of the "wishing
bone" of a fowl, and are, moreover, ever on the alert
to discover, what they consider, infallible omens from
any article of food which nursery tradition has stamped
as possessing such remarkable qualities. As we have
already pointed out <a href="#Page_29">in another chapter</a>, tea-leaves
often afford to both old and young a constant source
of amusement; and we may, now and then, find
some elderly damsel, who still aspires to enter one
day on the marriage state, taking care to put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
milk into her tea before the sugar lest she should
lose her chance of securing a sweetheart. Mrs. Latham,
too, tells us how matrimonial fortunes are often
told by seers at home from the grounds or sediment
remaining at the bottom of a tea-cup; and where to
unenlightened eyes nothing is apparent but a little
black dust floating in a slop, those who have the wit
to do so may discern a hidden meaning. Again,
among the host of small superstitions connected with
our daily meals, one at the very outset relates to
breakfast; there being a widespread belief that if a
person sings before breakfast, he will cry before
supper. This notion probably has some reference to
another popular one, namely, that high spirits forebode
evil, proving the forerunner of adversity.
Many anecdotes illustrative of this theory have been
recorded at various times. In the last act of <cite>Romeo
and Juliet</cite>, Romeo is introduced as saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dreams presage some joyful news at hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom's lord sits lightly on his throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all this day an unaccustomed spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the evidence given at the inquest upon the
bodies of four persons killed by an explosion at a
firework manufactory in Bermondsey, October 12th,
1849, one of the witnesses stated:&mdash;"On Friday they
were all very merry, and Mrs. B. said she feared
something would happen before they went to bed,
because they were so happy."</p>

<p>If, in a social gathering of any kind, an unmarried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
person is inadvertently placed between a man and his
wife, it is an indication that the individual so seated
will be married within the course of a year. Many
consider it unlucky to shake hands across the table;
and there is also an old superstition mentioned by
Grose, that, in eating, to miss the mouth and let
the food fall is a bad omen, betokening approaching
sickness. Once more, if a person in rising from table
overturns his chair, this is not a very fortunate
occurrence, as it is said to show that he has been
speaking untruths. Without further extending our
list of the superstitious beliefs and practices that
have clustered round the table&mdash;to which many of
our readers will doubtless be able to make their own
additions&mdash;we may briefly sum up this branch of the
subject by saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Folk-lore of the Looking-glass&mdash;Luck of Edenhall&mdash;Clock-falling&mdash;Chairs&mdash;Beds&mdash;The
Bellows.</p></blockquote>


<p>The desire to gather omens from the various surrounding
objects of every-day life has naturally included
articles of furniture; and hence we find signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and portents attached to certain of these which are
implicitly credited by many, from the highest to the
lowest, who, notwithstanding, would consider themselves
deeply insulted if the idea of their being
superstitious were only so much as hinted at by some
sceptical friend. Among the most common of these
odd fancies are those relating to the looking-glass.
As a piece of furniture this is most necessary, and its
very importance is, perhaps, the chief reason why
superstition has invested it with those mysterious
qualities which certainly do not belong in the same
ratio to chairs and tables. A chair, however beautiful
and costly in its manufacture, may nevertheless be
cruelly broken with perfect impunity; whereas, if
some wretched, dilapidated looking-glass is accidentally
cracked, the inmates of the house are
thoroughly discomposed, from a conviction that such
an event is sure to be followed by misfortune of some
kind or other. In Cornwall, the supposed penalty for
such an offence is seven years of sorrow; and a Yorkshire
proverb informs us that this unfortunate occurrence
entails "seven years' trouble, but no want." It
has also been said to foretell the speedy decease of the
master of the house; and in Scotland it is regarded as
an infallible sign that some member of the family will
shortly die. It has been suggested that this popular
superstition dates very many years back, and probably
originated in the terror inspired by the destruction of
the reflected human image&mdash;an interesting illustration
of how the formation of certain ideas is often determined
by mere analogy. A similar style of thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
also underlies the mediæval necromancer's practice of
making a waxen image of his enemy, and shooting at
it with arrows in order to bring about his death.</p>

<p>The folk-lore, however, of the looking-glass does
not end here; for many consider it the height of
ill-luck to see the new moon reflected in a looking-glass
or through a window-pane; and some mothers
studiously prevent their youngest child looking in one
until a year old. It is also associated with marriage
and death. Thus, in the South of England it is
regarded as a bad omen for a bride on her wedding
morning to take a last peep in the glass when she is
completely dressed in her bridal attire, before starting
for the church. Hence very great care is generally
taken to put on a glove or some slight article of
adornment after the final lingering and reluctant look
has been taken in the mirror. The idea is that any
young lady who is too fond of the looking-glass will
be unfortunate when married. This is by no means the
only occasion on which superstitious fancy interferes
with the grown-up maiden's peeps into the looking-glass.
Thus, Swedish young ladies are afraid of looking
in the glass after dark, or by candle-light, lest by so
doing they should forfeit the goodwill of the other sex.</p>

<p>The practice of covering the looking-glass, or removing
it from the chamber of death, still prevails in
some parts of England&mdash;the notion being that "all
vanity, all care for earthly beauty, are over with the
deceased." It has also been suggested that, as the
invisible world trenches closely upon the visible one
in the chamber of death, a superstitious dread is felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of some spiritual being imaging himself forth in the
blank surface of the mirror. Mr. Baring Gould
considers that the true reason for shrouding the looking-glass
before a funeral was that given him in
Warwickshire, where there is a popular notion that if
a person looks into a mirror in the chamber of death
he will see the corpse looking over his shoulder.
Again, Brand informs us that looking-glasses were
generally used by magicians "in their superstitious
and diabolical operations." He quotes an old authority,
who says:&mdash;"Some magicians, being curious
to find out by the help of a looking-glass, or a glass
full of water, a thing that lies hidden, make choice
of young maids to discern therein those images or
sights which a person defiled cannot see." Sometimes,
too, our ancestors dipped a looking-glass into the
water when they were anxious to ascertain what
would become of a sick person. Accordingly as he
looked well or ill in the glass, when covered with the
drops of water, so they foretold whether he would recover
or not. Mirrors were also regarded by our forefathers
as the most effective agencies in divining secrets
and bringing to light hidden mysteries. Thus, there is
a tradition that the Gunpowder Plot was discovered
by Dr. John Dee with his magic mirror. We find in
a prayer-book, printed by Baskett in 1737, an engraving
which depicts the following scene:&mdash;In the
centre is a circular looking-glass, in which is the
reflection of the Houses of Parliament by night, and
a person entering carrying a dark lantern. On the
left side there are two men in the costume of James's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
time looking into the mirror&mdash;one evidently the king,
the other probably Sir Kenelm Digby. On the right
side, at the top, is the eye of Providence darting a
ray on to the mirror; and below are some legs and
hoofs, as if evil spirits were flying out of the picture.
This plate, says a correspondent of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>,
"would seem to represent the method by which, under
Providence (as is evidenced by the eye), the discovery
of the Gunpowder Plot was at that time seriously
believed to have been effected. The tradition, moreover,
must have been generally believed, or it never
could have found its way into a prayer-book printed
by the king's printer." It may be noted, however,
that as the fame of Dee's magic mirror was at its
zenith about the time of the Gunpowder Plot, this
may have led to the mirror being adopted as a popular
emblem of discovery, or "throwing light" upon a
subject. Hence it has been reasonably suggested that
the mirror in the print may simply be a piece of
artistic design, rather than evidence of its actual
employment in the discovery.</p>

<p>In days gone by, too, it appears to have been
customary for both sexes to wear small looking-glasses&mdash;a
fantastic fashion much ridiculed by Ben Jonson
and others of his time. Men even wore them in
their hats&mdash;an allusion to which custom we find in
Ben Jonson's <cite>Cynthia's Revels</cite> (Act ii., sc. 1): "Where
is your page? Call for your casting-bottle, and place
your mirror in your hat as I told you." We may
infer that this was the very height of affectation by
the manner in which the remark is introduced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
While men of fashion wore mirrors as brooches or
ornaments in their hats, ladies carried them at their
girdles or on their breasts. Thus Lovelace makes a
lady say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"My lively shade thou ever shalt retaine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy inclosed feather-framed glasse."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was a popular superstition in former years that
fine glass, such as that of Venice, would break if
poison were put into it. To this curious notion
Massinger thus gracefully alludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Here crystal glasses . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i6">. . . . . . . . . . This pure metal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So innocent is, and faithful to the mistress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or master, that possesses it, that rather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than hold one drop that's venomous, of itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It flies in pieces, and deludes the traitor."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is among the errors noticed by Sir Thomas
Browne, who says, "And although it be said that
poison will break a Venice glass, yet have we not
met with any of that nature. Were there a truth
herein, it were the best preservative for princes and
persons exalted to such fears, and surely far better
than divers now in use." It may not be inappropriate
here to refer to the well-known tradition connected
with the "Luck of Edenhall." From time immemorial
there has been a current belief that any one who had
the courage to rush upon a fairy festival and snatch
from the merry throng their drinking-glass, would
find it prove to him a constant source of good fortune,
supposing he could carry it across a running stream.
A glass has been carefully preserved at Edenhall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Cumberland, which was in all probability a sacred
chalice; but the legend is that the butler, one
day going to draw water, surprised a company of
fairies who were amusing themselves on the grass
near the well. He seized the glass that was standing
upon its margin, which the fairies tried to recover, but,
after an ineffectual struggle, they vanished, crying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If that glass do break or fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell the luck of Edenhall."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The good fortune, however, of this ancient house
was never so much endangered as by the Duke of
Wharton, who, on one occasion having drunk the
contents of this magic glass, inadvertently dropped it,
and here most assuredly would for ever have terminated
the luck of Edenhall, if the butler, who
stood at his elbow to receive the empty glass, had not
happily caught it in his napkin.</p>

<p>Referring, however, more particularly to our
subject, we find several items of folk-lore associated
with the clock. Thus, in the North of England, there
is a superstition called "Clock-falling," the idea
being that if a woman enters a house after her
confinement, and before being churched, the house-clock
will immediately fall on its face. So strong
was this belief in years past that a woman would
never think of transgressing this rule under any
circumstances whatever. In some places the house-clock
is stopped on the occasion of a death, no doubt
to remind the survivors that with the deceased one
time is over, and that henceforth the days and hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
are no longer of any account to him. A correspondent
of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> informs us that he
knew "an intelligent, well-informed gentleman in
Scotland who, among his last injunctions on his
death-bed, ordered that as soon as he expired the
house-clock was to be stopped, a command which was
strictly obeyed." Aubrey also tells us that formerly
it was customary for people of a serious turn of mind
to say, every time they heard the clock strike, "Lord,
grant my last hour may be my best hour."</p>

<p>Chairs, again, have their superstitions. It is
regarded as a bad omen, for instance, if, when a
person leaves a house, he replaces the chair on which
he has been sitting against the wall, the probability
being that he will never visit the house again. The
chair on which a woman sits after her confinement
to receive the congratulations of her friends is
popularly termed "a groaning chair," an allusion to
which we find in "Poor Robin's Almanack":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"For a nurse, the child to dandle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sugar, soap, spiced pots, and candle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A groaning chair, and eke a cradle."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another article of furniture not without its folk-lore
is the bed. Thus some superstitious persons always
have their bedsteads placed parallel to the planks
of the floor, considering it unlucky to sleep across
the boards. Others again pay particular attention
to the point of the compass towards which the head
should be when in bed, a belief we find existing
even among the Hindoos, who believe that to sleep
with the head to the north will cause one's days to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
be shortened. To lie in the direction of the south
they say is productive of longevity, whereas the
east and west, it is asserted, are calculated to bring
riches and change of scene respectively. Various
theories in this country have been, at different times,
started as to the proper position of the bedstead
during the hours of sleep, which find ready acceptance
among those who are ever ready to grasp any
new idea, however fanciful it may be. A correspondent
of <cite>The Builder</cite>, writing on the subject,
says:&mdash;"So far as my own observations have gone, I
know that my sleep is always more sound when my
head is placed to the north. There are persons whom
I know, the head of whose bed is to the north, and
who, to awake early, will reverse their usual position
in the bed, but without knowing the reason why,
beyond 'that they could always wake earlier,' the
sleep being more broken." An eminent physician
in Scotland states that, when he failed by every other
prescription to bring sleep to invalid children, he
recommended their couches or little beds to be turned
due north and south&mdash;the head of the child being
placed towards the north&mdash;a process which he had
always found successful in promoting sleep. After all,
however, as has been so often said, the best prescription
for a good night's rest is a healthy body and a
sound mind.</p>

<p>The well-known phrase, "to get out of bed the
wrong way," or "with the left leg foremost," is
generally said of an ill-tempered person; the term
having originated in an ancient superstition, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
regarded it as unlucky to place the left foot first on
the ground on getting out of bed.</p>

<p>Once more, as a mark of the simplicity of ancient
manners, it was customary for persons even of the
highest rank to sleep together, an allusion to which
practice occurs in <cite>Henry V.</cite>, where Exeter says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom he hath cloy'd and grac'd with kingly favours."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In conclusion, we may take one further illustration
on this subject from that useful little article, the
bellows, to place which on a table is considered extremely
unlucky, and few servants will either do it or
allow it to be done.</p>

<p class="hang">Prevalence and Continuity of Superstitions&mdash;Sneezing&mdash;Stumbling&mdash;A
Whistling Woman&mdash;Sweeping&mdash;Breaking Crockery&mdash;Fires
and Candles&mdash;Money&mdash;Other Superstitions.</p></blockquote>


<p>It has often been asked how that formidable array of
superstitions, which are so firmly established in most
houses, came into being, and what is their origin?
Although indeed one may occasionally smile at the
"reign of terror" which these frequently exercise
over their credulous believers, yet it must be admitted
they are not limited to any one class. In discussing
and comparing the intellectual condition of one class
of society with another, we are apt, while passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
censure on the one for its odd notions and fanciful
beliefs, to forget how the other often cherishes the
very same, although it may be in a more disguised
form. Thus, by way of example, whereas some
ignorant persons resort to a cunning man or
"wise woman" for advice in case of emergency,
many an educated person is found consulting with
equal faith a clairvoyant or spirit-medium. While,
too, some uneducated person believes in a particular
omen, which is condemned by an intelligent community
as the height of folly, many cultivated people,
as we have said, may be found who hesitate before
sitting down to dinner when the party consists of
thirteen. However much, therefore, we may dislike
to own the fact, we must acknowledge that superstition
is a distinct element in the human character, although
under the influence of education it has not the same
opportunity for development as in the case of those
whose mental powers have never been thoroughly
trained. These superstitions, beliefs, and practices,
too, it must be remembered, have not sprung up in
a day, but have been handed down from generation
to generation in popular traditions, tales, rhymes,
and proverbs, and consequently have become so interwoven
with the daily life as to make it no easy task
to root them out. It has been truly said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"How superstitiously we mind our evils!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throwing down salt, or crossing of a hare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleeding at nose, the stumbling of a horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or singing of a cricket, are of power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To daunt whole man in us."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>As Mr. Tylor has truly shown, when a custom or
superstition is once fairly started in the world, disturbing
influences may long affect it so slightly that it
may keep its course from generation to generation, as
a stream once settled in its bed will flow on for ages.
Thus thousands of superstitions, the true meanings of
which have perished for centuries, continue to exist
simply because they have existed. A striking example
of this fact may be found in the widespread folk-lore
associated with the act of sneezing in this and other
countries, which may be traced back to the most
remote period. Thus, in the classic ages of Greece and
Rome, we read of the lucky sneeze of Telemachus, and
of Aristotle's remark that people consider a sneeze as
divine, but not a cough. On account of sneezing
being deemed lucky, it has always been customary
to salute the sneezer, a custom which the ancient
Greeks claimed to have derived from Prometheus,
who stole celestial fire to animate his newly-made
figure of clay. Tradition says that as the fire permeated
its frame, the creature sneezed, which caused
Prometheus to invoke blessings on it. Anyhow the
practice of salutation on sneezing dates from the
earliest times, and it is interesting to find a superstition
of this kind, which may be looked on as a
curiosity of primitive civilisation, still existing in our
midst. Thus, in the Midland counties, grandmothers
still exclaim, "God help you!" when they hear a
child sneeze; and it is a very common notion that
to sneeze three times before breakfast is a pledge
that one will soon receive a present of some kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
The sneezing of a cat is considered an evil omen, it
being a sign that the family will all have colds.
According to a Scotch superstition a new-born child
is in the fairy spells until it sneezes, but when this
takes place all danger is past. A correspondent of
<cite>Notes and Queries</cite> tells us that he once overheard
"an old and reverend-looking dame crooning over a
new-born child, and then, watching it intently and in
silence for nearly a minute, she said, taking a huge
pinch of snuff, 'Oich! Oich! No yet&mdash;no yet.'
Suddenly the youngster exploded in a startling
manner, into a tremendous sneeze; when the old
lady suddenly bent down and, as far as I could see,
drew her fore-finger across the brows of the child, very
much as if making the sign of the cross (although as
a strict Calvinist she would have been scandalised at
the idea), and joyfully exclaimed, 'God sain the bairn
it's <i>no a warlock</i>.'" Indeed it is a very prevalent
idea that no idiot ever sneezed or could sneeze.
Some attach importance to the day on which a person
sneezes; and in the West of England it is said that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Sneeze on Sunday morning fasting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll enjoy your own true love to everlasting."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another household superstition which has come
down to us from the far-off past is connected with
stumbling; frequent allusions to which occur in the
classic writers. Thus, at the present day to stumble
up-stairs is considered unlucky by some, but just the
reverse by others. Grose remarks that to stumble up
the stairs is a prognostic of good luck, and in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
places it is supposed to indicate that the stumbler if unmarried
will cease to be so before the year is out.
Others affirm that to stumble in the morning as soon
as one goes out of doors is a sign of ill-luck. As an
instance of this omen in ancient times, it is stated that
Tiberius Gracchus, as he was leaving his house on the
day of his death, stumbled upon the threshold with
such violence that he broke the nail of his great toe.
It is not necessary, however, to quote further cases of
this superstition in years gone by, it being sufficient
for our purpose to show that it has been handed down
to us by our ancestors, and that stumbling, like
sneezing, has always been regarded as an ominous act.
Again, stumbling at a grave has been ranked among
unlucky omens, a superstition to which Shakespeare
refers in <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> (Act v., sc. 3), where Friar
Laurence says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"How oft to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have my old feet stumbled at graves."<br /></span>

<p>We may also compare Gloucester's words in <cite>3 Henry
VI.</cite> (Act v., sc. 3):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"For many men that stumble at the threshold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are well foretold that danger lurks within."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hence various charms have been practised to
counteract the supposed ill-effect of this unlucky act,
upon which Poor Robin, in his "Almanack for 1695,"
quaintly remarks:&mdash;"All those who, walking the
streets, stumble at a stick or stone, and when they
are past it turn back again to spurn or kick the stone
they stumbled at, are liable to turn students in
Goatam College, and upon admittance to have a coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
put upon him, with a cap, a bauble, and other ornaments
belonging to his degree."</p>

<p>Again, in most places there is a very strong
antipathy to a woman whistling about a house, or
even out of doors, this act being said to be always
attended with fatal results. Thus, there is a Cornish
saying to the following effect:&mdash;"A whistling woman
and a crowing hen are the two unluckiest things under
the sun;" and the Northamptonshire peasantry have
this rhyme which is to the same purport:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"A whistling woman and crowing hen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are neither fit for God nor men."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or, according to another version:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"A whistling wife and a crowing hen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will call the old gentleman out of his den."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Why there should be this superstitious dislike to a
woman's whistling it is difficult to decide, but at
the same time it is a curious fact that one seldom
hears any of the fair sex amusing themselves in
this manner. Mr. Henderson informs us that the
seafaring part of the population on the coast of
Yorkshire have the same dread of hearing a woman
whistle. A few years ago, when a party of friends
were going on board a vessel at Scarborough, the
captain astonished them by declining to allow one of
them to enter it. "Not that young lady," he said,
"she whistles." Curiously enough the vessel was
lost on her next voyage; so, had the poor girl set
foot on it, the misfortune would certainly have been
ascribed to her. According to one legend, this superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
originated in the circumstance that a woman
stood by and whistled while she watched the nails for
the Cross being forged. A correspondent of <cite>Notes
and Queries</cite> assigns another origin. He tells us
that one day, after attempting in vain to get his dog
to obey orders to come into the house, his wife
essayed to whistle, when she was suddenly interrupted
by a servant, a Roman Catholic, who
exclaimed in the most piteous accents, "If you
please, ma'am, don't whistle. Every time a woman
whistles, the heart of the Blessed Virgin bleeds."
The French, it seems, have a similar prejudice to
hearing a woman whistle about a house, their proverb
being as follows:&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une poule qui chante le coq, et
une fille qui siffle, portent malheur dans la maison.</span>"</p>

<p>There are numerous signs and omens connected
with household work. Thus, in Suffolk, the people
say that if after sweeping a room the broom is
accidentally left up in a corner, strangers will visit
the house in the course of that day; while others
affirm, in the Northern counties, that to sweep dust
out of the house by the front door is equivalent to
sweeping away the good fortune and happiness of
the family. Care should rather be taken to
sweep inwards&mdash;the dust being carried out in a
basket or shovel&mdash;and then no harm will happen.
Furthermore, the spider, which in daily life is
little noticed except for its cobweb, the presence of
which in a house generally betokens neglect, is by no
means an unfriendly intruder. Although the servant
oftentimes ruthlessly sweeps this uncared-for little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
visitor away from the wall, yet a common proverb
reminds us that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"If you wish to live and thrive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the spider run alive,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>ill-luck being supposed to quickly overtake those who
kill or even so much as injure it. It was a notion
formerly prevalent in many parts of Scotland that
should a servant wilfully kill a spider, she would
certainly break a piece of crockery or glass before the
day was out. One reason why the spider is protected
against ill-usage is that it is supposed to bring prosperity;
but the real cause, perhaps, is due to the
influence of an old legend which relates how, when
Christ lay in the manger at Bethlehem, the spider
came and spun a web over the spot where He was,
thus preserving His life by screening Him from all
the dangers that surrounded Him.</p>

<p>Referring to the breaking of crockery, of which we
have just spoken, there is a prevalent idea that if a
servant breaks two things she will break a third. On
one occasion the mistress of a household in Suffolk
was not a little horrified at seeing one of her servants
take up a coarse earthenware basin and deliberately
throw it down upon the brick floor. "What did you
do that for?" she not unnaturally inquired. "Because,
ma'am, I'd broke two things," answered the servant,
"so I thout the third better be this here," pointing
to the remains of the least valuable piece of pottery
in the establishment, which had been sacrificed to
glut the vengeance of the offended ceramic deities.
A correspondent of Chambers' "Book of Days,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
alluding to another piece of superstition of this
kind, tells us that he once had a servant who was
very much given to breaking glass and crockery.
Plates and wine-glasses used to slip out of her
hands as if they had been soaped; even spoons
came jingling to the ground in rapid succession.
"Let her buy something," said the cook, "and
that will change the luck." "Decidedly," said the
mistress, "it will be as well that she feel the
inconvenience herself." "Oh, I didn't mean that,
ma'am!" was the reply; "I meant that it would
change the luck." A few days after this conversation,
on being asked whether she had broken anything
more, she answered, "No, sir, I haven't broken nothing
since I bout the 'tater dish." Unluckily, however,
this was too good to last; the breaking soon re-commenced,
and the servant was obliged to go.</p>

<p>A superstitious dread still attaches in household
matters to Friday as being an unlucky day, and many
will not even so much as turn a bed for fear of some
misfortune befalling them. Thus, in Northamptonshire,
we are told the housewife allows the bed to
remain unturned; and a Sussex saying admonishes
persons "never to begin a piece of work on Friday,
or they will never finish it." We may note here
that one tradition assigns a very early origin to the
unfortunate reputation of Friday, affirming that it
was on this day that Adam and Eve ate the forbidden
fruit. It is considered very unlucky to change servants
on this day of the week, and many try to avoid, if
possible, doing so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>That bright and ever-cheerful companion of our
homes in winter time, the fire, has given rise to a
host of omens and portents, many of which at times
create no small consternation when the events supposed
to be prognosticated are not of a very lucky
character. A hollow cinder, for example, thrown out
of the fire by a jet of gas from burning coals is
looked upon as a coffin if it be long, but as a money-box
if it be round. Some, too, exclaim on seeing the
fire suddenly blaze up that a stranger is near; whereas
in the Midland counties if the fire burn brightly
after it has been stirred, this is considered a sign that
the absent lover, wife, or husband, as the case may be,
is in good spirits. A very popular charm for reviving
a fire when it has burnt down is to set the poker across
the hearth, with the fore-part leaning against the top
bar of the grate. The poker and top bar thus combined
form a <i>cross</i>, and so defeat the malice of the witches
and demons who preside over smoky chimneys. One
notion is that the poker when in this position creates
a draught, but the real meaning of this harmless superstition
is, perhaps, the one that we have just given.
Various items of weather-lore, also, have been derived
from the way fires burn, an enumeration of which we
find in Willsford's "Nature's Secrets":&mdash;"When our
common fires do burn with a pale flame, they presage
foul weather. If the fire do make a buzzing noise, it
is a sign of tempests near at hand. When the fire
sparkleth very much, it is a sign of rain. If the
ashes on the hearth do clodder together of themselves,
it is a sign of rain. When pots are newly taken off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the fire, if they sparkle, the soot upon them being
incensed, it is a sign of rain. When the fire scorcheth
and burneth more vehemently than it useth to do, it
is a sign of frosty weather; but if the living coals do
shine brighter than commonly at other times, expect
then rain. If wood, or any other fuel, do crackle and
wind break forth more than ordinary, it is an evident
sign of some tempestuous weather near at hand; the
much and sudden falling of soot presages rain."
Once more, there is a curious notion that if a person
sit musing and intently looking into the fire, it is a
sign that a badly-disposed person is either fascinating
him for evil, or throwing an evil spell over him.
When this is the case, in order to break the spell,
some one without speaking or attracting notice should
take the tongs and turn the centre piece of coal in the
grate right over, at the same time repeating certain
words. While speaking of fires, we may note that
there is a belief among the Yorkshire peasants that
it is unlucky to allow a light to be taken out of their
houses on Christmas Day&mdash;a superstition which prevails
in Lancashire with regard to New Year's Day.
A few years ago a man was summoned at Bradford
on a charge of wilful damage by breaking a pane of
glass in a cottage window. Having entered for the
purpose of lighting his candle, the woman of the
house strongly remonstrated, but offered him instead
a few matches. The man then created a disturbance,
and on the husband trying to eject him he broke the
window.</p>

<p>Omens, too, from candles are very numerous. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
we may note that in some of the Northern counties
a bright spark in the candle predicts the arrival
of a letter, and if it drops on the first shake, it is
an indication that the letter has already been posted.
To snuff out a candle accidentally is a sign of matrimony,
and a curious mode of divination is still practised
by means of a pin and a candle. The anxious lover,
while the candle is burning, takes a pin and cautiously
sticks it through the wax, taking care that it pierces
the wick, repeating meanwhile the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"It's not this candle alone I stick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But A. B.'s heart I mean to prick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether he be asleep or awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd have him come to me and speak."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>She then patiently watches, for if the pin remains
in the wick after the candle has burnt below the place
in which it was inserted, then the loved one will be
sure to appear; but should the pin drop out, it is a
sign that he is faithless.</p>

<p>There are, however, a host of other superstitions
relating to home-life, some of which we can only
briefly describe, scattered as they are here and there
over the United Kingdom, and varying in different
localities. Thus, according to a well-known superstition,
if a person suddenly shivers, it is a sign that
some one is walking over his future grave, a notion
which is not limited to any particular county, extending
as far north as Scotland. It is fortunate, however,
that all persons are not subject to this sensation,
otherwise the inhabitants of those districts or parishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
whose burial-grounds are much frequented would, as
an old antiquarian writer has observed, "live in one
continued fit of shaking." Some, too, deem it unlucky
to turn back after they have once started on some
errand, or to be recalled and told of something previously
forgotten. This superstition extends beyond
our own country, and is found on the Continent, as for
example in Sweden, where it is considered unadvisable
not only to turn round when one is going on business,
lest it should turn out ill, but even so much as to
look back. At the present day, too, in the Midland
counties, children are frequently cautioned by their
parents not to walk backwards when going on some
errand, it being regarded as a sure sign that misfortune
will befall them if they disobey this injunction.
Akin to this superstition, there are several others of
a similar kind, among which we may include the
supposed ill-luck of walking under a ladder; and North-country
people have a dislike to meeting a left-handed
person on a Tuesday morning, although on other days
it is considered fortunate to do so. Referring to the
many other items of folk-lore associated with our daily
life, we must not omit those relating to money. Thus,
it is generally acknowledged to be a bad omen to
find it; and to insure health and prosperity, one
should always turn a piece of money in one's pocket on
first seeing the new moon, and on hearing the cuckoo
in spring. There is, too, the common custom of the
lower orders to spit on money for "luck's sake," a
practice which is not only found in foreign countries,
but may be traced back to ancient times. Misson, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his "Travels in England," describes this piece of superstition
as it prevailed in this country in former years:&mdash;"A
woman that goes much to market told me t'other
day that the butcher-women of London, those that sell
fowls, butter, eggs, etc., and in general most tradespeople,
have a peculiar esteem for what they call a
<i>handsel</i>, that is to say, the first money they receive in
the morning they kiss it, spit upon it, and put it in
a pocket by itself." Many, too, as a charm against
poverty, carry a piece of money, with a hole in it, or
one that is bent, in allusion to which Gay says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"This silver ring beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three silver pennies, and a nine-pence bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A token kind to Brunkinet is sent."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Others, again, dislike "counting their gains," a
superstition which, it has been suggested, may have
some connection with David's sin in numbering the
people of Israel and Judah. Hence some regard
with feelings of strong antipathy our own decennial
census, and it is only the compulsion of the law which
induces them to comply with this national means of
ascertaining the state of the population. Among minor
superstitions, it is said that smoke and dust always
follow the fairest; and if without any neglect, but even
with care, articles of steel, such as keys, knives, &amp;c.,
continually become rusty, it is a sign that some kind-hearted
person is laying up money for one's benefit.</p>

<p>When, too, as often by coincidence happens, two
persons in conversation are on the point of telling
each other the same thing, it is an indication that
some lie will before long be told about them; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
think that if the two immediately join hands and wish
silently, their desires cannot fail to come to pass. Some
again, have a strong objection either to being weighed
or to having their likeness taken, the latter superstition
being mentioned by Mr. Napier as prevalent
in some parts of Scotland. Once more, there is a
belief among the Sussex peasantry that bottles which
have contained medicine should never be sold, or else
they will soon be required to be filled again for some
one in the house. These are some of the quaint
superstitions with which even the trivial occurrences
of home life are surrounded, and although, according
to one view, many of these have little or no foundation
for their existence beyond their traditionary
history, yet it is a remarkable fact that they should
have preserved their characteristic traits in spite of
the long course of years through which they have
travelled down to us from the past.</p>

<small>POPULAR DIVINATIONS.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Bible and Key&mdash;Dipping&mdash;Sieve and Shears&mdash;Crowing of the
Cock&mdash;Spatulamancia&mdash;Palmistry and Onymancy&mdash;Look-divination&mdash;Astrology&mdash;Cards&mdash;Casting
Lot&mdash;Tea-stalks.</p></blockquote>


<p>The practice of divination, or foretelling future events,
has existed amongst most nations in all ages; and,
although not so popular as in days gone by, yet it
still retains its hold on the popular mind. Many of
the methods for diving into futurity are extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
curious, and instances of them occasionally find their
way into the papers. In a <a href="#CHAPTER_III">previous chapter</a> we
have already shown how numerous are the divinations
practised in love affairs, and what an importance is
attached to them by the maiden bent on ascertaining
her lot in the marriage state. There are, however,
many other ends to which this species of superstition
is employed, one being the detection of guilt. Thus,
a common method is by the "Bible and the Key,"
which is resorted to more or less by the humbler
classes from one end of the United Kingdom to the
other, the mode of procedure being as follows:&mdash;The
key is placed on a certain chapter, and the Sacred
Volume closed and fastened tightly. The Bible and
the key are then suspended to a nail, the accused
person's name is repeated three times by one of those
present, while another recites these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If it turns to thee thou art the thief,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And we all are free."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This incantation being concluded, should the key be
found to have turned, it is unanimously agreed that
the accused is the guilty one. Not very long ago, a
lady residing at Ludlow having lost a sheet made use
of this test. Armed with a copy of the Sacred Book,
she perambulated the neighbourhood, placing the key
in the volume near several houses. At last, on
arriving before a certain door, it was alleged that the
key with much alacrity began, of its own accord, to
turn; whereupon the owner of the lost sheet uttered
the suspected person's name as loudly as she could;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
after which, it is said, the Bible turned completely
round and fell on the ground. Again, a year or two
ago, at Southampton, a boy working on a collier was
charged with theft, the only evidence against him
being such as was afforded by the ordeal of the Bible
and key. It seems that the mate and some others
swung a Bible attached to a key with a piece of yarn,
the key being placed on the first chapter of Ruth.
While the Bible was turning, the names of several
persons suspected were called over, but on mention of
the prisoner's the book fell on the ground. The bench,
of course, discharged the prisoner.</p>

<p>Closely akin to this method of divination is the
well-known mediæval diversion known as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sortes
Virgilianæ</i>, which consisted in opening a volume of
Virgil's works, and forecasting the future from some
word or passage selected at random. The Sacred
Book is now the modern substitute, and there is
no doubt but that the superstition is thousands of
years older than even the Virgil of the Augustan age.
This custom, practised in many parts of England on
New Year's Day, is called "Dipping." A Bible is
laid on the table at breakfast-time, and those who
wish to consult it open its pages at random; it being
supposed that the events of the ensuing year will
be in some way foreshown by the contents of the
chapter contained in the two open pages. Sometimes
the anxious inquirer will take the Bible to bed with
him on New Year's Eve, and on awaking after twelve
o'clock, open it in the dark, mark a verse with his
thumb, turn down a corner of the page, and replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the book under the pillow. That verse is said to be a
prophecy of the good or bad luck that will befall him
during the coming year. This as a mode of divination
is extensively practised. Another form of this superstition
consists in foretelling the events in a man's
life from the last chapter of the Book of Proverbs,
the thirty-one verses of this chapter being supposed
to have a mystical reference to the corresponding days
of the month. Thus, it is predicted of persons born
on the 14th that they will get their "food from
afar." A correspondent of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, writing
from a Northamptonshire village, tells us that "this
is so fully believed in by some that a boy has actually
been apprenticed to a <em>linen</em>-draper, for no other
reason than because he was born on the 24th of the
month; whilst those born on the 13th would be sent
to a <em>woollen</em>-draper. The twenty-fourth verse speaks
of 'fine linen,' and the thirteenth of 'wool.'"</p>

<p>Another means of discovering a guilty person is
by the "Sieve and Shears," one of those divinatory
instruments upon which such implicit reliance has
been placed by superstitious folk from time out of
mind, described as it is in the "Hudibras" as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Th' oracle of sieve and shears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That turns as certain as the spheres."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The sieve is held hanging by a thread, or else by
the points of a pair of shears stuck into its rim,
it being supposed to turn, or swing, or fall at the
mention of a thief's name, and give similar signs for
other purposes. This ancient rite was formerly known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
as the "Trick of the Sieve and Scissors," and was
generally practised among the Greeks for ascertaining
crime. We find an allusion to it in Theocritus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"To Agrio, too, I made the same demand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cunning woman she, I cross'd her hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turn'd the sieve and shears, and told me true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I should love, but not be lov'd by you."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Among other modes of divination practised for the
same purpose, there is one by the crowing of the cock.
Thus, a farmer in Cornwall having been robbed of
some property, invited all his neighbours into his
cottage, and when they were assembled he placed
a cock under the "brandice" (an iron vessel formerly
much used by the peasantry in baking), he then asked
each one to touch the brandice with the third finger,
and say, "In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, speak." Every one did as they were directed,
and yet no sound came from beneath the brandice.
The last person was a woman who occasionally
laboured for the farmer in his field. She hung back,
hoping to pass unobserved amidst the crowd. The
neighbours, however, would not permit her to do
so, and no sooner had she touched the brandice than,
before she could even utter the prescribed words,
the cock crew. Thereupon she fainted on the spot,
and on recovering confessed her guilt.</p>

<p>In the North of England there was formerly a
curious process of divination in the case of a person
bewitched:&mdash;A black hen was stolen, the heart taken
out, stuck full of pins, and roasted at midnight. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was then supposed that the "double" of the witch
would come and nearly pull the door down. If,
however, the "double" was not seen, any one of the
neighbours who had passed a remarkably bad night
was fixed upon.</p>

<p>Referring in the next place to what may be considered
the principal object of divination, a knowledge
of futurity, we find various mystic arts in
use to gain this purpose. Foremost among these may
be reckoned "Spatulamancia," "reading the speal-bone,"
or "divination by the blade-bone," an art
which is of very ancient origin. It is, we are told
by Mr. Tylor, especially found in Tartary, whence it
may have spread into all other countries where we
hear of it. The mode of procedure is as follows:&mdash;The
shoulder-blade is put on the fire till it cracks in
various directions, and then a long split lengthwise
is reckoned as "the way of life," while cross-cracks
on the right and left stand for different kinds of good
and evil fortune, and so on. In Ireland, Camden
speaks of looking through the blade-bone of a sheep,
to discover a black spot which foretells a death; and
Drayton in his "Polyolbion" thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"By th' shoulder of a ram from off the right side par'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which usually they boile, the spade-bone being bar'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which when the wizard takes, and gazing thereupon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things long to come foreshows, as things done long agone."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This species of divination was in days gone by
much practised in Scotland, and a good account of the
Highland custom of thus divining is given by Mr. Thoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in the "Folk-Lore Record" (i. 177), from a manuscript
account by Mr. Donald McPherson, a bookseller
of Chelsea, a Highlander born, and who was
well acquainted with the superstitions of his countrymen:&mdash;"Before
the shoulder-blade is inspected, the
whole of the flesh must be stripped clean off, without
the use of any metal, either by a bone or a hard wooden
knife, or by the teeth. Most of the discoveries are
made by inspecting the spots that may be observed in
the semi-transparent part of the blade; but very great
proficients penetrate into futurity though the opaque
parts also. Nothing can be known that may happen
beyond the circle of the ensuing year. The discoveries
made have relation only to the person for
whom the sacrifice is offered."</p>

<p>Chiromancy, or palmistry, as a means of unravelling
hidden things, still finds favour not only with
gipsy fortune-tellers, but even with those who profess
to belong to the intelligent classes of society. This
branch of fortune-telling flourished in ancient Greece
and Italy, as we are informed it still does in India,
where to say, "It is written on the palms of my hands,"
is the ordinary way of expressing what is looked upon
as inevitable. The professors of this art formerly
attributed to it a Divine origin, quoting as their
authority the following verse from the Book of Job:
"He sealeth up the hand of every man, that all men
may know his work;" or as the Vulgate renders the
passage: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui in manu omnium hominum signa
posuit</span>"&mdash;"Who has placed signs in the hand of all
men"&mdash;which certainly gives it a more chiromantical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
meaning. Thus chiromancy, or palmistry, traces the
future from an examination of the "lines" of the
palm of the hand, each of which has its own peculiar
character and name, as for instance the line of long
life, of married life, of fortune, and so on. However
childish this system may be, it still has its numerous
votaries, and can often be seen in full force at our
provincial fairs. Referring to its popularity in this
country in former years, we find it severely censured
by various writers. Thus one author of the year 1612
speaks of "vain and frivolous devices of which sort
we have an infinite number, also used amongst us, as
namely in palmistry, where men's fortunes are told by
looking on the palms of the hand."</p>

<p>A superstition akin to palmistry is onymancy, or
divination by the finger-nails, which is still a widespread
object of belief. Sir Thomas Browne, in his
"Vulgar Errors," describing it, admits that conjectures
"of prevalent humours may be gathered from
the spots on the nails," but rejects the sundry prognostications
usually derived from them, such as "that
spots on the tops of the nails signify things past, in
the middle things present, and at the bottom events
to come; that white specks presage our felicity, blue
ones our misfortunes; that those in the nail of the
thumb have significations of honour, of the fore-finger
riches." As practised at the present day, this mode
of divination differs in various counties. Thus, in
Sussex, we are told by Mrs. Latham that the fortune-tellers
commence with the thumb, and say "A gift,"
judging of its probable size by that of the mark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
They then touch the fore-finger, and add "A friend;"
and should they find a spot upon the nail of the
middle finger, they gravely affirm it denotes the
existence of an enemy somewhere. It is the presence
or absence of such a mark on the third finger that
proves one's future good or ill success in love; whereas
one on the little finger is a warning that the person
will soon have to undergo a journey.</p>

<p>Again, some profess to be able to tell events by the
face, or "look-divination"&mdash;a species of physiognomy
which was formerly much believed in by all classes
of society, and may still be met with in country
villages. Indeed, there is scarcely a mark on
the face which has not been supposed to betoken
something or other; and in a book of "Palmistry
and Physiognomy," translated by Fabian Withers,
1656, are recorded sundry modes of divination from
"upright eyebrows, brows hanging over, narrow foreheads,
faces plain and flat, lean faces, sad faces, sharp
noses, ape-like noses, thick nostrils," &amp;c. However
foolish these may appear, yet there will always be
simple-minded persons ready to make themselves
miserable by believing that the future events of their
life&mdash;either for weal or woe&mdash;are indelibly written on
their face. Equally illogical and fanciful is that
pseudo-science, astrology, whereby the affairs of
men, it is said, can be read from the motions of
the heavenly bodies. A proof of the extensive belief
at the present day in this mode of divination may be
gathered from the piles of "Zadkiel's Almanacks"
which regularly appear in the fashionable booksellers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
windows about Christmas-time. That educated people,
who must be aware how names of stars and constellations
have been arbitrarily given by astronomers,
should still find in these materials for calculating
human events, is a curious case of superstitious survival.
Very many, for instance, are firmly convinced
that a child born under the "Crab" will not do well
in life, and that another born under the "Waterman"
is likely to meet with a watery death, and so forth.
This science, as is well known, is of very old institution,
and originated in a great measure in the
primitive ages of the world, when animating intelligences
were supposed to reside in the celestial bodies.
As these mythical conceptions, however, have long ago
passed away under the influence of civilisation, one
would scarcely expect to find in our enlightened nineteenth
century so great a number of intellectual persons
putting faith in such a system of delusion. In this
respect, happily, we are not worse than our Continental
neighbours; for there are many districts in
Germany where the child's horoscope is still regularly
kept with the baptismal certificate in the family
chest. In days gone by, this kind of divination was
very widely credited in this country, and by most of
our old writers is most unsparingly condemned. Thus
Shakespeare, in <cite>King Lear</cite> (Act i., sc. 2), has ridiculed
it in a masterly way, when he represents Edmund as
saying: "This is the excellent foppery of the world, that
when we are sick in fortune&mdash;often the surfeit of our
own behaviour&mdash;we make guilty of our disasters the
sun, the moon, and the stars, as if we were villains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
by necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves,
thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience
of planetary influence." Sir Thomas Browne
goes so far as to attribute divination by astrology
to Satan, remarking how he "makes the ignorant
ascribe natural effects to supernatural causes; and
thus deludes them with this form of error." And
another old writer sensibly adds that, although astrologers
undertake "to tell all people most obscure
and hidden secrets abroad, they at the same
time know not what happens in their own houses
and in their own chambers." In spite, however, of
the frequent denunciations of this popular form of
superstition, it appears that they had little effect, for
James I. was notorious for his credulity about such
delusions; and both Charles I. and Cromwell are
said to have consulted astrologers.</p>

<p>A further form of divination still much practised
is by a pack of cards, most of these being supposed to
have a symbolical meaning; the king of hearts, for
example, denoting a true-loving swain, and the
king of diamonds indicating great wealth. The following
quaint lines, extracted from an old chap-book
quoted in Brand's "Popular Antiquities," describe
this mode of fortune-telling as it was formerly consulted
by our credulous countrymen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"This noble king of diamond shows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou long shalt live where pleasure flows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when a woman draws the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great melancholy songs she'll sing.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He that draws the ace of hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall surely be a man of parts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she that draws it, I profess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will have the gift of idleness."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Indeed, scarcely a month passes without several persons
being punished for extorting money from silly
people, on the pretence of revealing to them by card-divination
their future condition in life. Among the
gipsies this is the favourite form of fortune-telling;
and its omens are eagerly received by anxious aspirants
after matrimony, who are ever desirous to know
whether their husbands are to be tall or short, dark
or fair, rich or poor, and so on. Mrs. Latham tells us
of a certain woman who was reported to be skilful in
such matters, and was in the habit of confidently
foretelling with a pack of cards her fellow-servants'
coming lot in matrimony. The mode of procedure
was as follows:&mdash;The cards were dealt round by
the diviner, with much mystical calculation, and
the fortunate maiden who found the ace of diamonds
in her heap was to marry a rich man. The
one, however, who was unlucky enough to have the
knave of clubs or spades was destined to have
nothing but poverty and misery in her wedded state.
Again, the presence of the king of diamonds or of
hearts in hand was a sign that the possessor's partner
for life would be a fair man, while the king of
clubs or spades gave warning that he would
be dark. To find in one's heap either the knave
of hearts or of diamonds was most ominous, as it
revealed an unknown enemy. Again, divination by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
casting lot has not yet fallen into disuse. According
to some this means of deciding doubtful matters
is of God's appointment, and therefore cannot fail,
the following text being quoted as a proof: "The
lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing
thereof is of the Lord" (Proverbs xvi. 33). In
Lancashire, when boys do not wish to divide anything
they decide "who must take all" by drawing
"short cuts." A number of straws, pieces of twine,
&amp;c., of different lengths, are held by one not interested,
so that an equal portion of each is alone
visible; each boy draws one, and he who gets the
longest is entitled to the prize.</p>

<p>A new-laid egg affords another means of diving
into futurity. The person anxious to be enlightened
about his future perforates with a pin the small end
of an egg, and lets three drops of the white fall into
a basin of water, which soon diffuse themselves on
the surface into a variety of fantastic shapes. From
these the fortune-teller will predict the fortune of
the credulous one, the character of his future wife,
and a variety of particulars concerning his domestic
happiness. A similar practice is kept up in Denmark,
where young women melt lead on New Year's
Eve, and after pouring it into water, observe on the
following morning what form it has assumed. If it
resembles a pair of scissors, they will inevitably marry
tailors; if a hammer, their husbands will be smiths,
and so on.</p>

<p>Divination by a staff was formerly a common
practice in Scotland. When a person wished to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on a pleasure excursion into the country, and was
unsettled in his mind as to which way to go, he
resorted to this form of consulting fate. Taking a
stick, he would poise it perpendicularly, and then
leave it to fall of itself; and he would select the direction
towards which it pointed while it lay on the
ground. It has been suggested by some of our
Biblical scholars that it is to this sort of divination
that the prophet Hosea referred when he said "Their
staff declareth unto them;" but this is mere conjecture.</p>

<p>Among other common modes of divination may be
mentioned that by tea-stalks. If two appear on the
surface of a cup of tea, they should be placed on the
back of the left hand, and struck with the back of the
right. If they remain unmoved on the left, or adhere
to the right, then it is an omen that the absent loved
one will remain faithful. Tea-stalks are also said to
foretell visitors, indicating the person to be visited by
floating to the side of the individual. We might
easily extend our list of popular divinations, but
space forbids our doing so; and those already enumerated
in the preceding pages have perhaps given
a sufficient idea of the devices which have been
resorted to, from time to time, by our superstitious
country-folk for gaining an insight into futurity.</p>

<small>COMMON AILMENTS.</small></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Charm-remedies&mdash;For Ague&mdash;Bleeding of the Nose&mdash;Burns&mdash;Cramp&mdash;Epilepsy&mdash;Fits&mdash;Gout&mdash;Headache,
&amp;c.</p></blockquote>


<p>At the present day, in spite of the "march of intellect,"
there is still a widespread belief in the prevention
and cure of the common ailments of life by
certain remedies, which take the form of charms
and amulets, or are preserved in those countless
quaint recipes which, from time immemorial, have
been handed down from parent to child. Indeed,
thousands of our population place far greater faith in
their domestic treatment of disease than in the skill
of medical science, one of the chief requirements being
that the patient should submit to the treatment recommended
for his recovery with a full and earnest
belief that a cure will be effected. Hence, however
eccentric the remedy for some complaint may be,
we occasionally find not only the ignorant but even
educated classes scrupulously obeying the directions
enjoined on them, although these are often by no
means easy of accomplishment. Therefore, as most
of the ordinary ailments of every-day life have what
are popularly termed in folk-medicine their "charm-remedies,"
we shall give a brief account of some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
these remedies in the present chapter, arranging the
diseases they are supposed to cure in alphabetical order.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Ague.</i>&mdash;No complaint, perhaps, has offered more
opportunities for the employment of charms than
this one, owing in a great measure to an old superstition
that it is not amenable to medical treatment.
Thus, innumerable remedies have been suggested for
its cure, many of which embody the strangest superstitious
fancies. According to a popular notion,
fright is a good cure, and by way of illustration we
may quote the case of a gentleman, afflicted by this
disease in an aggravated form, who entertained a
great fear of rats. On one occasion he was accidentally
confined in a room with one of these unwelcome
visitors, and the intruder jumped upon
him. The intensity of his alarm is said to have
driven out the ague, and to have completely cured
him. An amusing anecdote is also told of a poor
woman who had suffered from this unenviable complaint
for a long time. Her husband having heard
of persons being cured by fright, one day came to
her with a very long face, and informed her that
her favourite pig was dead. Her first impulse was
to rush to the scene of the catastrophe, where she
found to her great relief that piggy was alive and
well. The fright, however, had done its work,
and from that day forth she never had a touch of
ague, although she resided in the same locality. A
Sussex remedy prescribes "seven sage leaves to be
eaten by the patient fasting seven mornings running;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and in Suffolk the patient is advised to take a
handful of salt, and to bury it in the ground, the
idea being that as the salt dissolves so he will lose
his ague. A Devonshire piece of folk-lore tells us
that a person suffering from ague may easily give
it to his neighbour by burying under his threshold a
bag containing the parings of a dead man's nails, and
some of the hairs of his head. Some people wear a
leaf of tansy in their shoes, and others consider pills
made of a spider's web equally efficacious, one pill
being taken before breakfast for three successive
mornings.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Bleeding of the Nose.</i>&mdash;A key, on account of the
coldness of the metal of which it is composed, is
often placed on the person's back; and hence the
term "key-cold" has become proverbial, an allusion to
which we find in <cite>King Richard III.</cite> (Act i., sc. 2),
where Lady Anne, speaking of the corpse of King
Henry VI., exclaims:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"Poor key-cold figure of a holy king."</p>


<p>A Norfolk remedy consists in wearing a skein of
scarlet silk round the neck, tied with nine knots
in the front. If the patient is a male, the silk
should be put on and the knots tied by a female,
and <i>vice versâ</i>. In some places a toad is killed by
transfixing it with some sharp-pointed instrument,
after which it is enclosed in a little bag and suspended
round the neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Burn or Scald.</i>&mdash;According to a deep-rooted notion
among our rural population, the most efficacious cure
for a scald or burn is to be found in certain word-charms,
mostly of a religious character. One
example runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"There came two angels from the north,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One was Fire, and one was Frost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out Fire: in Frost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Many of our peasantry, instead of consulting a
doctor in the case of a severe burn, often resort to
some old woman supposed to possess the gift of
healing. A person of this description formerly resided
in a village in Suffolk. When consulted she
prepared a kind of ointment, which she placed on the
part affected, and after making the sign of the cross,
repeated the following formula three times:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"There were two angels came from the north,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One brought fire, the other brought frost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come out fire, go in frost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, as the reader will see, is in substance the same
as the one quoted above, and is a fair sample of those
used in other localities.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Cramp.</i>&mdash;Of the many charms resorted to for the
cure of this painful disorder, a common one consists
in wearing about the person the patella or knee-cap
of a sheep or lamb, which is known in some places
as the "cramp-bone." This is worn as near the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
as possible, and at night is laid under the pillow. In
many counties finger-rings made from the screws or
handles of coffins are still considered excellent preservatives,
and in Lancashire it is prevented by either
placing the shoes at bed-time with the toes just
peeping from beneath the coverlet, or by carrying
brimstone about with one during the day. Some,
again, wear a tortoise-shell ring, while others have
equal faith in tying the garter round the left
leg below the knee. In days gone by a celebrated
cure for this complaint was the "cramp-ring," allusions
to which we find in many of our old authors.
Its supposed virtue was conferred by solemn consecration
on Good Friday.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Epilepsy.</i>&mdash;The remedies for this terrible disorder
are extremely curious, and in most cases vary in
different localities. One, however, very popular
charm is a ring made from a piece of silver money
collected at the offertory. A correspondent of
Chambers's "Book of Days" tells us that when
he was a boy a person "came to his father (a clergyman)
and asked for a 'sacramental shilling,' <i>i.e.</i>, one
out of the alms collected at the Holy Communion, to
be made into a ring and worn as a cure for epilepsy."
In the North of England "a sacramental piece,"
as it is usually called, is the sovereign remedy for this
complaint. Thirty pence are to be begged of thirty
poor widows. They are then to be carried to the
church minister, for which he is to give the applicant
a half-crown piece from the communion alms. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
being "walked with nine times up and down the
church aisle," the piece is then to have a hole drilled in
it, and to be hung round the neck by a ribbon. It has
been suggested that these widows' pence may have some
reference to the widow's mite which was so estimable
in the eyes of Christ. According to one notion, persons
afflicted with epileptic fits are supposed to be
bewitched, and the following extraordinary remedy is
sometimes resorted to for their cure. A quart bottle
is filled with pins, and placed in front of the fire until
the pins are red-hot. As soon as this takes place it
is supposed they will prick the heart of the witch,
who to avoid the pain caused by the red-hot pins will
release her victim from the suffering she has imposed
upon him. This mode of disenchantment seems to have
been of common occurrence; and sometimes, when
old houses are under repair, bottles full of pins are
found secreted in out-of-the-way places. Another
remedy is for the patient to creep, head foremost,
down three pair of stairs, three times a day, for
three successive days. Sir Thomas Brown, too, discourses
of the virtues of mistletoe in this complaint;
and Sir John Colbach, writing in the year
1720, strongly recommends it as a medicine, adding
that this beautiful plant must have been designed by
the Almighty "for further and more noble purposes
than barely to feed thrushes, or to be hung up superstitiously
in houses to drive away evil spirits."</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Erysipelas.</i>&mdash;This distemper has been popularly
called "St. Anthony's Fire," from the legend that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
it was miraculously checked by that saint when
raging in many parts of Europe in the eleventh
century. An amulet formerly worn to ward it off
was made of the elder on which the sun had never
shone. "If," says an old writer, "the piece between
the two knots be hung about the patient's neck,
it is much commended. Some cut it in little pieces,
and sew it in a knot in a piece of a man's shirt."
A remedy in use among the lower orders, and
extending as far as the Highlands, is to cut off one
half of the ear of a cat, and to let the blood drop on
the part affected&mdash;a practice which is evidently a
survival of the primitive notion that a living sacrifice
appeased the wrath of God.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Fits.</i>&mdash;Numerous indeed have been the charms invented
for those suffering from this malady, and in
many cases they are "marvellously mystical withal."
Thus that little animal the mole has been in request,
as the following mystic prescription will show. A
gentleman residing in 1865, on the border ground of
Norfolk and Suffolk, was one day asked by a neighbour
to catch a live mole, as "her darter's little
gal was subject to fits, and she had been told that if
she got a live mole, cut the tip of his nose off, and let
nine drops bleed on to a lump of sugar, and gave that
to the child, 'twas a sartin cure." Here again we have
the same notion of a sacrifice, one which, it may be
noticed, underlies many of the charms of this kind.
A Devonshire remedy is to go into a church at midnight
and to walk three times round the Communion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
table, while many single women wear a silver ring
on the wedding-ring finger, made out of sixpences
which have been begged from six young bachelors.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Gout.</i>&mdash;The periodical attacks of this disease have
from the earliest times been subjected to the influence
of charms, blackberries being considered by the Greeks
a good specific. Culpeper has bequeathed to us a
curious remedy. He says, "Take an owl, pull off
her feathers, and pull out her guts; salt her well for
a week, then put her into a pot, and stop it close, and
put her into an oven, that so she may be brought into
a mummy, which, being beat into powder and mixed
with boar's grease, is an excellent remedy for gout,
anointing the grieved place by the fire." The germander
speedwell has been esteemed highly efficacious,
and the Emperor Charles V. is reported to have
derived benefit from it.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Headache.</i>&mdash;Cures to alleviate this tiresome pain
are numberless. Mrs. Latham mentions what is
considered by the Sussex peasantry a sure way of
avoiding it in the spring, a piece of superstition we
have already noticed: "No hair, either cut or
combed from the head, must be thrown carelessly
away, lest some bird should find it and carry it
off, in which case the person's head would ache
during all the time that the bird was busy working
the spoil into its nest. 'I knew how it would be,'
exclaimed a servant, 'when I saw that bird fly away
with a bit of my hair that blew out of the window this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
morning when I was dressing; I knew I should have
a clapping headache, and so I have.'" In some counties
the common corn-poppy is called "headache," from the
cephalalgic tendency of the scent.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Hydrophobia.</i>&mdash;From the most remote period no
disease, perhaps, has possessed such a curious history,
or been invested with so many superstitions as hydrophobia,
and the countless remedies suggested for its
cure form an important chapter in folk-medicine. In
tracing back its history, we find that it was not only
regarded by our ancestors with the same horror as
now-a-days, but that every conceivable device was
resorted to for removing its fatal effects. Thus, Pliny
relates the case of a Roman soldier who was cured by
the dog-rose, a remedy said to have been revealed to
the man's mother in a dream. Among sundry other
remedies he enumerates the hair of a man's head,
goose-grease, fuller's earth, colewort, fish-brine, &amp;c., as
applications to the wounds. The favourite cure of
Dioscorides was hellebore, and Galen's principal one
was the river-crab. Sucking the wound seems also
to have been considered efficacious. Passing on to
modern times, the extraordinary remedies still employed
are a convincing proof of the extent to which
superstition occasionally reaches. The list, indeed, is
not an inviting one, consisting amongst other things
of the liver of a male goat, the tail of a shrew-mouse,
the brain and comb of a cock, the worm under the
tongue of a mad dog, horse-dung, pounded ants, and
cuckoo soup. It may seem, too, incredible to us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
less than a century ago the suffocation of the wretched
victim was not unfrequently resorted to, and instances
of this barbarous practice may be found in the
periodical literature of bygone years. Thus, in <cite>The
Dublin Chronicle</cite> (28th October, 1798), the following
circumstances are recorded:&mdash;"A fine boy, aged
fourteen, was bitten by a lady's lap-dog near Dublin.
In about two hours the youth was seized with
convulsive fits, and shortly after with hydrophobia;
and, notwithstanding every assistance, his friends
were obliged to smother him between two feather
beds." In the year 1712, four persons were tried at
York Assizes for smothering a boy, who had been
bitten by a mad dog, on a similar plea as that
uttered by Othello:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"I that am cruel am yet merciful:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not have thee linger in thy pain."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As recently as the year 1867 this mode of death
was put into execution in the town of Greenfield,
Michigan. A little girl having been seized with
hydrophobia, a consultation was held by the physicians,
and as soon as it had been decided by them
that she could not recover, her parents put an end
to her sufferings by smothering her to death. The
folk-lore of this disease is most extensive, and as our
space is limited we cannot do better than recommend
our readers to consult Mr. Dolan's capital volume on
"Rabies, or Hydrophobia," which contains an excellent
description of the antiquity and history of this
cruel complaint, and of superstitions which surround it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Hysteria.</i>&mdash;This disorder, which assumes so many
deceptive forms, was formerly known as "the mother,"
or "hysterica passio," an allusion to which occurs in
<cite>King Lear</cite> (Act ii., sc. 4), where Shakespeare represents
the king as saying,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hysterica passio!</i> down, thou climbing sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy element's below!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Some of the charms used for its cure are much
the same as those employed in cases of epilepsy, a
favourite one being the wearing of a ring made of a
certain number of silver pieces obtained from persons
of the opposite sex.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Jaundice.</i>&mdash;Many of the remedies recommended
for this complaint are not of a very agreeable kind,
as, for instance, the following one mentioned by a
correspondent of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, first, as having
been resorted to in a Dorsetshire parish, where the
patient was ordered to eat nine lice on a piece of
bread and butter. One popular charm in days gone
by, and certainly not of a very refined character, was
known as the cure by transplantation, and consisted
in burying in a dunghill an odd number of cakes
made of ashes and other ingredients.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Lameness.</i>&mdash;Sleeping on stones, on a particular
night, is an old method of curing lameness practised
in Cornwall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Lumbago.</i>&mdash;In Dundee it is customary to wear
round the loins as a cure for lumbago a hank of yarn
which has been charmed by a wise woman, and girls
may be seen with single threads of the same round the
head as an infallible specific for tic-douloureux.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Measles.</i>&mdash;In the quarterly return of the marriages,
births, and deaths registered in the provinces,
&amp;c., in Ireland, published in October, 1878, we find
the following extraordinary cure for measles, administered
with what results will be seen:&mdash;"Sixty-three
cases of measles appear on the medical relief
register for past quarter, but this does not represent a
third of those affected, the medical officers being only
called in when the usual amount of local nostrums
had been tried without effect. Every case seen
suffered from violent diarrh&oelig;a, caused by the administration
of a noxious compound called <i>crooke</i>.
This consists of a mixture of porter, sulphur, and
the excrement of the sheep collected in the fields.
Every unfortunate child that showed any symptom
of measles was compelled to drink large quantities
of this mixture. All ordinary remedies failed to
stop the diarrh&oelig;a thus produced, in many cases the
children nearly dying from exhaustion." Repulsive
as this piece of folk-medicine is, yet it is only
one of a most extensive class of the same kind,
many being most revolting. It is difficult to conceive
how either ignorance or superstition could
tolerate any practice of so senseless and indelicate a
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Paralysis.</i>&mdash;One of the popular charms for this
disease is the same as that used in the case of epilepsy,
namely, a silver ring made from money solicited from a
certain number of persons. Cowslips, too, have been
esteemed highly efficacious, and have on this account
been termed "Herbæ Paralysis" by medical writers.
For the same reason they are called "Palsyworts" in
many country places.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Rheumatism.</i>&mdash;Professors of the healing art have
advised the sufferer to carry about in his pocket
the right fore-foot of a female hare, while others
consider a potato equally efficacious. A Cornish
cure is to crawl under a bramble which has formed
a second root in the ground, or to drink water in
which a thunder-stone has been boiled. There is,
also, a strong belief that a <i>galvanic ring</i>, as it is
called, worn on the finger will serve as an excellent
preservative. "A large number of persons," says
Mr. Glyde in his "Norfolk Garland," "may be
seen with a clumsy-looking silver ring, which has a
piece of copper let into the inside, and this, though
in constant contact throughout, is supposed (aided by
the moisture of the hand) to keep up a gentle but
continual galvanic current, and so alleviate rheumatism."
A Sussex remedy is to place the bellows
in the sufferer's chair that he may lean against them,
and so have his rheumatism charmed away.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Spasms.</i>&mdash;The belief in the curative powers of
the form of the cross still holds its sway in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
popular mind, and in the case of spasms, or that painful
state of the feet in which they are said "to sleep,"
it is used under an impression that it allays the pain.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Small-pox.</i>&mdash;The curative properties attributed to
some colours is illustrated by the treatment formerly
employed in cases of small-pox. Thus, red bed-coverings
were thought to bring the pustules to the surface
of the body, and the patient was recommended to look
at red substances. Purple dye, pomegranate seeds,
or other red ingredients were dissolved in his drink,
with the idea that as red is the colour of the blood,
so disorders of the blood system should be treated
by red. The renowned English physician, John
of Gaddesden, introduced the practice into this
country, and tried its efficacy on one of the sons
of King Edward I., adding to his report, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et est
bona cura</span>." Fried mice are considered in some
counties a good specific for this complaint, it being
thought necessary by some that they should be
fried alive.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Sprain.</i>&mdash;Many of the charms practised in an
accident of this kind are of a semi-religious character,
and of a not very reverent form. Thus, to cure a
sprain, a thread called the "wresting-thread" is tied
round the injured part, after which the following
formula is repeated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Our Saviour rade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fore-foot slade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our Saviour lighted down;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sinew to sinew&mdash;joint to joint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood to blood, and bone to bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mend thou in God's name."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This incantation, which, it has been suggested, may
have originated in some legend of Christ's life, is
frequently mentioned in the witch trials of the early
part of the seventeenth century.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Sty.</i>&mdash;To prevent or cure this disorder, known in
some places as "west," it is customary on the first
sight of the new moon to seize a black cat by the
tail, and after pulling from it one hair, to rub the tip
nine times over the pustule. As this charm, however,
is often attended with sundry severe scratches, a gold
ring has been substituted, and is said to be equally
beneficial. This superstition is alluded to by Beaumont
and Fletcher, in the <cite>Mad Lovers</cite> (Act v., sc. 4):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"&mdash;&mdash;I have a sty here, Chilax.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Chil.</i> I have no gold to cure it, not a penny."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Earrings are considered a good remedy for sore
eyes; and in districts where the teasle is grown for
use in the manufacture of broadcloth, a preservative
against them is found in the water which collects in
the hollow cups of that plant. Pure rain-water is
reported to be another infallible remedy. This must
be carefully collected in a clean open vessel during
the month of June, and if preserved in a bottle
will, it is said, remain pure for any length of
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Thrush.</i>&mdash;There is a popular notion that a person
must have this complaint once in his life, either at
his birth or death. Norfolk nurses prefer to see it
in babies, on the plea that it is healthy, and makes
them feed more freely; but if it appears in a sick
adult person he is generally given over as past recovery.
Some of the remedies for this disease are
curious, as, for instance, a Cornish one, which recommends
the child to be taken fasting on three consecutive
mornings, "to have its mouth blown into"
by a posthumous child. In Devonshire the parent is
advised to take three rushes from any running stream,
and to pass them separately through the mouth of the
infant. Afterwards the rushes should be thrown into
the stream again, and as the current bears them away,
so will the thrush, it is said, depart from the child.
Should this prove ineffectual, the parent is recommended
to capture the nearest duck that can be
found, and to place its beak, wide open, within the
mouth of the sufferer. As the child inhales the cold
breath of the duck, the disease, we are told, will
gradually disappear. A further charm consists in
reading the eighth Psalm over the child's head three
times every day on three days in the week for three
successive weeks.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Toothache.</i>&mdash;This common ailment, which produces
so much discomfort, unfortunately rarely meets with
a degree of sympathy proportionate to the agony
it occasions, but has nevertheless been honoured
with an extensive folk-lore; and the quaint remedies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that superstitious fancy has suggested for its cure
would occupy a small volume if treated with anything
like fulness. Selecting some of the best
known, we may mention one which, in point of
efficacy, is considered by many as unsurpassed,
namely, a tooth taken from the mouth of a corpse,
and worn round the neck as an amulet. Occasionally
a double-nut is carried in the pocket for
the same purpose. There is a belief, too, that
the possession of a Bible or a Prayer Book,
with the following legend written in it, is an
effectual charm:&mdash;"All glory, all glory, all glory
be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
Holy Ghost. As our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
was walking in the Garden of Gethsemane, He
saw Peter weeping. He called him unto Him, and
said, 'Peter, why weepest thou?' Peter answered
and said, 'Lord, I am grievously tormented with
pain&mdash;the pain of my tooth.' Our Lord answered
and said, 'If thou wilt believe in Me, and My words
abide with thee, thou shalt never feel any more pain
in thy tooth.' Peter said, 'Lord, I believe; help
Thou mine unbelief.' In the name, &amp;c., God grant
M. N. ease from the pain in his tooth." These charm
formulas, which constitute an important element in
folk-lore literature, are still extensively used in this
country to arrest or cure some bodily disease;
and they are interesting as being in most cases
modified forms of those used by our Anglo-Saxon
ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><i>Typhus Fever.</i>&mdash;Even for so dangerous a disease
as typhus fever, our peasantry do not hesitate to
practise their own remedies. One consists in applying
the skirt of a sheep to the soles of the feet, and
keeping it there for several hours, under a notion
that this will draw away the fever from the head.
Some years ago a clergyman in Norfolk, whilst visiting
a poor man suffering from this complaint, found
that his wife had placed the spleen of a cow on
the soles of his feet, having been assured that it
was an efficacious remedy. There is another story
that the rector of a Norfolk parish was solicited
for the loan of the church plate to lay on the stomach
of a child, which was much swelled from some mesenteric
disease, this being held to be an excellent remedy
in such cases.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Warts.</i>&mdash;These have been regarded as prognostications
of good or bad luck according to their position on
the body, those on the right hand foreboding riches,
whereas one on the face is believed to indicate
troubles of various kinds. It would be difficult to
enumerate the many methods that have been adopted
to charm or drive them away, most persons disliking
these ugly little excrescences, and willingly resorting
to any means, however eccentric, to lose them. As
in the case of so many other charms, most of those
used also for this complaint are of the nature of a
sacrifice, the warts being transferred to a substitute.
Thus, the person is recommended to count his warts,
to wrap in a piece of paper a pebble for each, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
then to throw the parcel away, in the hope that its
unfortunate finder will get them. Another remedy
is to open the warts to the quick, and to rub
them with the juice of a sour apple, which should
afterwards be buried, and as it decomposes the warts
will die away. Some rub the wart with eels' blood,
and others believe in the efficacy of the ashen tree.
After picking each wart with a pin, they stick it into
the bark, and repeat this rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Ashen tree, ashen tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray buy these warts of me."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>An Irish servant's formula is to pass his hand over
the warts, making the sign of the cross, at the same
time bidding them, in God's name, depart and trouble
him no more. He then gives some one a slip of paper,
on which is written "Jesus Christ, that died upon the
cross, put my warts away," to drop by the roadside.
It is thought that as it perishes, so, too, will the
warts vanish. Another plan is to steal a piece of
raw meat, rub the warts with it, and throw it away,
a charm mentioned by Southey in "The Doctor."
Other remedies are the juice of ants, spiders' webs,
pigs' blood, while tying a horse-hair round each wart
is considered efficacious. Another method is to blow
on the warts nine times when the moon is full;
and in some places boys take a new pin, cross the
warts with it nine times, and cast it over the left
shoulder. These, then, are some of the principal
cures for warts, most of them, as we have already
said, belonging to the category of vicarious charms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
which have at all times been one of the favourite
resources of poor mortals in their difficulties&mdash;such
charms being sacrifices made on the principle so widely
adopted&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui facit per alium facit per se</i>.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Wen.</i>&mdash;The same notion of vicariousness enters
into the cures recommended for wens, one of the
most efficacious being the touch of a dead man's
hand. And Grose informs us how, in days gone
by, children were brought by their nurses to be
stroked with the hands of dead criminals, even whilst
they were hanging on the gallows. In Northamptonshire
numbers of sufferers were in the habit of congregating
round the gallows, in order to receive "the
dead-stroke," the notion being that as the hand of the
man mouldered away, so the wen would by degrees
decrease. In Gloucestershire an ornamental necklace
made of plaited hair from a horse's tail is thought to
be a good remedy.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>Whooping-Cough.</i>&mdash;This common enemy of childhood
has, from time immemorial, afforded ample
opportunity to the superstitiously-inclined to devise
sundry charms for its cure, of which the following are
a few:&mdash;Passing the patient three times under the
belly and three times over the back of a donkey; or
let the parent of the afflicted child catch a spider,
and hold it over the head of the child, repeating three
times:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Spider, as you waste away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whooping-cough no longer stay."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>The spider must then be hung up in a bag over the
mantlepiece, and when it has dried up the cough
will have disappeared. There is a notion in Cheshire
that this complaint can be cured by holding a toad
or frog for a few moments with its head within
the child's mouth, whereas in Norfolk the patient
is advised either to drink some milk which a ferret
has lapped, or to allow himself to be dragged three
times round a gooseberry bush or bramble, and then
three times again after three days' interval. In
Sussex the excrescence often found on the briar-rose,
and known as the "Robin Redbreast's Cushion," is
worn as an amulet; and in Suffolk, if several
children in a family are taken ill, some of the hair
of the oldest child is cut into small pieces, put into
some milk, and the mixture given to its brothers
and sisters to drink. Some, again, procure hair
from the dark cross on the back of a donkey, and
having placed it in a bag, hang it round the child's
neck. A Scotch remedy is to place a piece of red
flannel round the patient's neck; the virtue residing,
says Mr. Napier, not in the flannel but in the red
colour, red having been a colour symbolical of
triumph and victory over all enemies.</p>


<p class="p2">As may be seen, therefore, from the extensive
use of charm-remedies in household medicine, the
physician's province has been assailed by the widespread
belief in such imaginary remedies. Indeed,
those who believe in the prevention and cure of disease
by supernatural means are far more numerous than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
one would imagine, having their representatives even
among the higher classes. However much we may
ridicule the superstitious notions of our rural peasantry,
or speak with compassion of the African negro
who carries about him some amulet as a preservative
against disease or as a safeguard against any danger
that may befall him, yet we must admit that there
is in England also a disposition to retain, with more
or less veneration, those old-world notions which in
the time of our forefathers constituted, as it were,
so many articles of faith.</p>

<small>MISCELLANEOUS HOUSEHOLD LORE.</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">Horse-shoes&mdash;Precautions against Witchcraft&mdash;The Charmer&mdash;Second
Sight&mdash;Ghosts&mdash;Dreams&mdash;Nightmare.</p></blockquote>


<p>The belief in witchcraft, which in years gone by was
so extensively entertained, has not yet died out, and
in many of our country villages it is regarded as one
of those secret dangers to which every home is more
or less exposed. Hence we find various devices still
resorted to for the purpose of counteracting the supposed
hurtful influences of this baneful power, instances
of which we subjoin. Thus, according to a common
idea, one of the best preservatives is a horse-shoe nailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to the threshold. The reason of this is said to be that
Mars, the god of war, and the war-horse, was thought to
be an enemy to Saturn, who, according to a mediæval
idea, was the liege lord of witches. Thus, iron
instruments of any kind have been said to keep
witches at bay, a superstition which has been traced
back to the time of the Romans, who drove nails into
the walls of their houses as an antidote against the
plague. Mr. Napier says that he has seen the horse-shoe
in large beer-shops in London, and was present in the
parlour of one of these when an animated discussion
arose as to whether it was most effective to have the
shoe nailed behind the door or upon the first step of
the door. Both positions had their advocates, and
instances of extraordinary luck were recounted as
having attended them.</p>

<p>In Lancashire, where there are, perhaps, more
superstitions connected with this subject than in any
other county of England, we find numerous traditions
relating to the evil actions of the so-called witches in
former years, many of which have become household
stories among the peasants. At the present day the
good housewife puts a hot iron into the cream during
the process of churning to expel the witch from the
churn; and dough in preparation for the baker is
protected by being marked with the figure of a cross.
In some places a "lucky stone"&mdash;a stone with a hole
through it&mdash;is worn as an amulet, and crossed straws
and knives laid on the floor are held in high repute.
A belief, too, which was once very prevalent, and
even still lingers on, was that the power of evil ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as soon as blood was drawn from the witch. An
instance of this superstition occurred some years ago
in a Cornish village, when a man was summoned
before the bench of magistrates and fined for having
assaulted the plaintiff and scratched her with a pin.
Not many years ago a young girl in delicate health
living in a village near Exeter was thought to have
been bewitched by an old woman of that place, and,
according to the general opinion, the only chance
of curing her was an application of the witch's
blood. Consequently the girl's friends laid wait one
day for the poor old woman, and scratching her with
a nail till the blood flowed, collected the blood. This
they carried home, and smeared the girl with it in
the hope that it would insure recovery. Curious to
say, she finally got well, an event which, it is needless
to add, was attributed to this charm. It is still
thought by many that witchcraft, like hydrophobia,
is contagious, and that the person, if only slightly
scratched by a witch, rapidly becomes one. The
faculty of witchcraft is also said to be hereditary, and
in some places families are pointed out as possessing
this peculiarity. Again, witches are supposed to have
the power of changing their shape and resuming it
again at will, a notion which was very popular in past
years, the cat's and the toad's being the forms they
were thought to assume. Hence the appearance of a
toad on the doorstep is taken as a certain sign that
the house is under evil influence, and the poor reptile
is often subjected to some cruel death. Cats,
also, were formerly exposed to rough usage, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
method being to enclose them with a quantity of soot
in wooden bottles suspended on a line. The person
who succeeded in beating out the bottom of the
bottle as he run under it and yet escaping the contents
was the hero of the sport, a practice to which
Shakespeare alludes in <cite>Much Ado about Nothing</cite>, where
Benedick says:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"Hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me."</p>


<p>It is only natural, too, that in <cite>Macbeth</cite>, Shakespeare,
in his description of the witches, should have
associated them with the cat, their recognised
agent.</p>

<p>Another important character whose supernatural
powers are still credited is the "charmer." She is
generally an elderly woman of good reputation, and
supposed to be gifted with extraordinary powers, by
means of which she performs wonderful feats of
skill. By her incantations and mysterious ceremonies
she stops blood, cures all manner of diseases, and is,
in short, regarded as almost a miracle-worker. At
the same time, however, it must not be imagined that
she exercises her power gratuitously, as oftentimes
her charges are very high, and it is only by patient
saving that the poor can accumulate enough to satisfy
her exorbitant demands. This kind of superstition
has been already incidentally alluded to in the
<a href="#CHAPTER_XII">chapter on "Common Ailments</a>;" and it is one that
still holds its ground in our country districts. These
supposed charmers, however, do not always make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
trade of their art; for, on the contrary, it is supposed
by some of them that any offer of pecuniary remuneration
would break the spell, and render the charm of
no avail.</p>

<p>Again, there is still an extensive belief in "second
sight," certain persons being thought to possess the
faculty of peeping into futurity, and revealing future
events to their fellow-creatures. Many of the Highlanders
lay claim to this power, which was called by
the ancient Gaels "shadow-sight."</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Nor less availed his optic sleight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Scottish gift of second-sight."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sometimes, says Mr. Napier, the person fell into
a trance, "in which state he saw visions; at other
times the visions were seen without the trance condition.
Should the seer see in a vision a certain
person dressed in a shroud, this betokened that the
death of that person would surely take place within a
year. Should such a vision be seen in the morning,
the person seen would die before that evening; should
such a vision be seen in the afternoon, the person seen
would die before next night; but if the vision were
seen late in the evening, there was no particular time
of death intimated, further than that it would take
place within the year. Again, if the shroud did not
cover the whole body, the fulfilment of the vision was
at a great distance. If the vision were that of a man
with a woman standing at his left hand, then that
woman would be that man's wife, although they may
both at the time of the vision be married to others."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
The case is related of a man living near Blackpool
who foretold death and evil events from his visions.
Men of superior ability were credulous enough to
visit him, and to give implicit faith to his marvellous
stories.</p>

<p>A species of superstition that may be said to reign
supreme in almost every home is the belief in ghosts,
there being few households that do not contain those
who believe in ghostly visitants. In this respect,
therefore, we are not superior to our less instructed
forefathers whose experiences have been transmitted
to us in many of those weird and thrilling stories
which are to be found recorded in many of our old
county histories. Indeed, there is scarcely a village
in England that does not boast of the proud distinction
of having its haunted house or spot. Hence as
nightfall approaches with its sombre hues of darkness,
few persons can be found bold enough to visit such
mysterious localities, for&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Grey superstition's whisper dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Debars the spot to vulgar tread."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Although many of these grotesque stories which have
been from time to time associated with certain old
houses are simply legendary and destitute of any
truth, yet it cannot be denied that while occasionally
causing fear even to the strong-minded they
have acted most injuriously upon the credulous and
superstitious. According to an old fancy, ghosts of
every description vanish at cock-crow, in allusion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
which Shakespeare makes the ghost of Hamlet's
father vanish at this season:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">"It faded on the crowing of the cock."</p>


<p>One night, however, in the year has been said to be
entirely free from spiritual manifestations of every
kind&mdash;namely Christmas Eve&mdash;an idea to which
Marcellus refers, who, speaking of the ghost, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird of dawning singeth all night long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hallow'd and so gracious is the time."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But on other days of the year, every noise at night,
however trivial, which cannot be satisfactorily explained
by inquisitive minds, is thought by the
superstitious to indicate that spirits are walking
abroad; such illogical persons forgetting how in the
stillness of the night sounds, which at other times
would pass unnoticed, attract attention, and thus
assume an exaggerated importance. In this way the
whistling of the wind, the creaking of the floor, and
a host of other natural noises have in the deceptive
hours of midnight terrified their nervous victim, and
filled the overwrought fancy with the most alarming
delusions.</p>

<p>An amusing volume might be written showing how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
most of the ghost stories connected with so-called
haunted houses have arisen. Thus, as Mrs. Latham
points out in her "West Sussex Superstitions," there
is very little doubt but that the ghosts formerly seen
wandering in blue flames, near lonely houses on the
coast, "were of an illicit class of spirits, raised by
the smugglers in order to alarm and drive all others
but their accomplices from their haunts." On one
occasion, for instance, the unearthly noises heard
night after night in a house at Rottingdean caused
such alarm among the servants, that they all gave
warning, when one night the noises ceased, and
soon afterwards a gang of smugglers who had fallen
into the hands of the police confessed to having
made a secret passage from the beach close by the
house, and said that, wishing to induce the occupiers
to abandon it, they had been in the habit of rolling
at the dead of night tub after tub of spirits up the
passage, and so caused it to be reported that the
place was haunted.</p>

<p>Ghosts are said to be especially fond of walking
abroad on certain nights, the chief of these being St.
Mark's Eve, Midsummer Eve, and Hallowe'en. Hence
various methods have been resorted to for the purpose
of invoking them with a view of gaining an insight into
futurity, love-sick maidens, as we have said, seizing
these golden opportunities for gaining information
about their absent lovers. It must not be supposed, too,
that apparitions are confined to the spirits of the departed,
as throughout the country there are the most
eccentric traditions of headless animals having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
seen at sundry times rushing madly about at night-time.</p>

<p>Leaving, however, the subject of ghosts, we find in
the next place an extensive folk-lore associated with
dreams. We have already incidentally alluded to the
many divinations practised for the sake of acquiring
information by means of them on certain subjects,
but we may further note that dreams are by some
supposed occasionally to intimate not only future
events, but things which are actually happening at
a distance. Hence a "Dictionary of Dreams"
has been framed whereby the inquirer, if he be
credulously disposed, can learn the meaning and
signification of any particular dream which he
may recollect. Thus, it is said that to dream of
death denotes happiness and long life, but to dream
of gathering a nosegay is unlucky, signifying that
our best and fairest hopes shall wither away like
flowers in a nosegay. Dreaming about balls, dances,
&amp;c., indicates coming good fortune; and thus we are
told that those&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Who dream of being at a ball<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No cause have they for fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon will they united be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To those they hold most dear."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To give one further illustration, to dream that one
is walking in a garden, and that the trees are bare and
fruitless, is a very bad omen, being said to indicate
that one's friends will either become poor or forsake
one. If the garden, on the other hand, should be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
bloom, it is a propitious sign. Portents of approaching
death are said to be received through dreams; and
we will quote an example of this from Mr. Henderson,
which happened, it is affirmed, some years ago in the
family of an Irish bishop:&mdash;"A little boy came down-stairs
one morning, saying, 'Oh, mamma, I have had
such a nice dream. Somebody gave me such a pretty
box, and I am sure it was for me, for there was
my name on it. Look, it was just like this;' and,
taking up a slate and pencil, the child drew the
shape of a coffin. The parents gazed at one another
in alarm, not lessened by the gambols of the child,
who frolicked about in high health and spirits. The
father was obliged to go out that morning, but he
begged the mother to keep the child in her sight
through the day. She did so, till, while she was dressing
to go out in her carriage, the little boy slipped
away to the stables, where he begged the coachman to
take him by his side while he drove to the house door,
a thing he had often done before. On this occasion,
however, the horses were restive, the driver lost
control over them, and the child was flung off and
killed on the spot." Shylock, it may be remembered,
in the <cite>Merchant of Venice</cite>, referring to his dream,
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I did dream of money-bags to-night."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Many curious charms are still practised to ward off
that unpleasant sensation popularly known as nightmare,
which both in this and other countries has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
given rise to a variety of superstitions. According
to one old notion, this disagreeable feeling was
produced by some fairy, under a disguised form,
visiting the person, and worrying him while asleep
by certain mischievous pranks. Thus, in Germany,
the nightmare is said to appear at times in the shape
of a mouse, a weasel, or a toad, and occasionally, too,
in the form of a cat. One German story relates how
a joiner was, night by night, much plagued with the
nightmare, when he at last saw it steal into his room
about midnight in the form of a cat. Having at
once stopped up the hole through which the cat had
entered, he lost no time in seizing the animal and
nailing it by one paw to the ground. Next morning,
however, much to his horror and surprise, he discovered
a handsome young lady with a nail driven
through her hand. He accordingly married her,
but one day he uncovered the hole which he had
stopped up, whereupon she instantly escaped through
it in the shape of a cat, and never returned. There
are numerous stories of a similar kind, in most cases
the sequel being the same. Among the charms still
in use as a preservative against nightmare may be
mentioned a stone with a natural hole in it hung
over the sleeper, or a knife laid under the foot of
the bedstead, both being considered of equal efficacy.
In Lancashire the peasantry believe that nightmare
appears in the form of a dog, and they try to
counteract its influence by placing their shoes under
the bed with the toe upwards, on retiring to rest.
Not very long ago, too, at the West Riding Court at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Bradford, in a case of a husband and wife who had
quarrelled, the woman stated that the reason why she
kept a coal-rake in her bedroom was that she suffered
from nightmare, and had been informed that the rake
would keep it away. The best charm after all,
however, for this common disorder is to be careful
that one's digestive organs are not upset by incautious
suppers eaten just before retiring to rest.</p>

<p>It only remains for us, in conclusion, to add once
more that the preceding pages are not intended to be
by any means exhaustive, our object having been to
give a brief and general survey of that extensive folk-lore
which has, in the course of years, woven itself
around the affairs of home-life. However much this
may be ridiculed on the plea of its being the outcome
of credulous belief, yet it constitutes an important
element in our social life, which the historian in years
to come will doubtless use when he studies the character
of the English people in this and bygone centuries.</p>
